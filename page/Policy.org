** California Online Privacy Protection Act

- CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
  and online services to post a privacy policy
- This is a personal website, not commercial, but I feel like it is useful
  here
- The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
  company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
  websites collecting personally identifiable information from California
  consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website accurately stating the data being collected and those individuals with whom it
  is being shared and to comply with this policy.
- See more [[http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf][here]].
