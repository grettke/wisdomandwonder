- This site is a "notebook style" blog. Intending to capture my notes,
  it includes everything ranging from simple links and personal reflection to
  code, articles, and projects. Keeping to the "notebook style" blog approach,
  if you find anything valuable here, then I am happy to have shared it with
  you.
- My pledge to you is that I am honest and open about both my intent and means
  by which I publish that content on this site.
- I will:
  - Say what I do.
  - Do what I say.
  - Conspicuously document it in [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/site-policy][this privacy policy]].

  - To the best of my ability, this blog both complies with and facilitates
    all applicable laws in both letter and spirit to make that happen.

- Using [[https://analytics.google.com][Google Analytics,]] I analyze and optimize your content and reading
  experience through the use of cookies. [[https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites][Here]] is how Google uses your

** California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)

- CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
  and online services to post a privacy policy.
- This is a personal website, not commercial, but I feel like it is useful
  here.
- The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or
  company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
  websites collecting personally identifiable information from California
  consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website accurately stating the data being collected and those individuals with whom it
  is being shared and to comply with this policy.
- See more [[http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf][here]].

*** According to CalOPPA I agree to the following

- You can visit this site anonymously.
- The footer of every page on this site contains a link to this [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/site-policy][Privacy Policy]].
  - Any privacy policy changes will be noted here.
- If you have an account then you can change your personal information by
  logging in.
- This site does not implement "Do Not Track" signals.

** General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- At your request I will:
  - Erase your data.
  - Export your data and send it to:
    - you.
    - another party you specify.
  - Update your data.

** Things Having Entirely to Do With Money

- This blog relies on me to pay for it. I am it's only source of funding.
- You will never find ads, affiliate links, sponsored content, or any other such things here.
  - *IF YOU DO THEN PLEASE NOTIFY ME IMMEDIATELY!*
- If I were ever gifted something in exchange for an honest review then I will say so in the post.

** Things Having Entirely to Do with the Server

*** Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

- This website is only available over a secure protocol increasing the
  likelihood that when your site talks to my site, it is /really/ your site
  talking to my site

*** Web Server Logs

- Apache keeps access and error logs.
- The logs contain IP addresses of URLs requested.
- They are helpful to debug site errors and issues.
- The logs are private to me, and I don't share them with anyone unless I am
  legally required to do so.
- I keep them around for as long as is useful.
