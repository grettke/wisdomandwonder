#+TITLE: CB750F: Day 20

-  Realized that I ought to post as of the date of when the work occurred and will do so moving forward.
-  Got the front sprocket count, 15 +16+. The crank case was filthy, 4mm think of chain oil and gunk. Cleaned it up.
-  Tried to take a photo to show the shifter lever height.
-  Cleaned up the engine hangers.
-  Couldn't find fine brass wheel brushes anywhere; will research online.
-  Verified that fuel line fits carbs.
-  Tidied up; the number of parts and supplies has again multiplied.
-  Confirmed that WordPress reverses the image order regardless of how I select the files. This is undesirable since the images are out of order in relation to the post itself; need to find a fix.
