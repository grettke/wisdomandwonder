  Thomas, Manhattan Beach, CA - Starting a tech company

Thomas is 10 years old and he wants to start a software company with his friends! He programs in C++, Java, and Python?! Wow. Leo says he wants Thomas to learn these programs right, not just noodling with them and learning bad habits. So Leo says that Alice is a good place to start, but Leo suggests HTDP.ORG. It's a programming book written by software professors all over the country and teaches "SCHEME," which is a "flavor" of a programming language called LISP. Download DrScheme. This will teach you to plan, design, and organize your software ideas.
