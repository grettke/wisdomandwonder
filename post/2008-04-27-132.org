#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  is a new syntax frontend for Haskell. Next to its syntax in the form of symbolic expressions --- which is also known as Lisp --- Liskell also features an extended meta-programming facility. Its aim is to get the best of both worlds: being pure and functional with type inference in the tradition of Haskell, while providing the simplicity and uniformity in its syntax that is necessary for meta-programming.
