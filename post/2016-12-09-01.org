[[http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/news.html][Wada]] (creator of the Happy Hacking Keyboard): because keyboards are
accessories to PC makers, they focus on minimizing the manufacturing costs.
But that's incorrect. It's in HHKB's slogan, but when America's cowboys were
in the middle of a trip and their horse died, they would leave the horse
there. But even if they were in the middle of a desert, they would take their
saddle with them. The horse was a consumable good, but the saddle was an
interface that their bodies had gotten used to. In the same vein, PCs are
consumable goods, while keyboards are important interfaces.
