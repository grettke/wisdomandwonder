#+TITLE: The Dylan Resource Guide

I started learning more about Dylan by reading the material listed in the [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.dylan/browse_thread/thread/708805852fccf72f][Dylan Resource Guide]] in [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.dylan/topics][comp.lang.dylan]]. It is true what they say; Dylan and Scheme seem to be very similar. When you take into account what Dylan [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/link/884/the-dylan-programming-language][purports to offer]], it sounds very interesting!

Here are some links from the resource guide:
