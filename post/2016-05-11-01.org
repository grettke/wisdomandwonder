#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 35: Mainstream 96 Key Emacs Keyboard Layout

- Going too far from the mainstream pushes the cost up too high
- Let key do things that Emacs knows how to do well to leverage keyboard firmware

- [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51252.0][EasyAVR]] is great, but stick closer to mainstream with [[https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard][tmk]]
- Start with [[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10222/emacs-keyboard-design-34-grid-layout-revisited][layout 34]]
- Six rows is closer to a common row count, lets you use any type of
  keycap
  - First two rows are unoccupied anyway
  - Remove first two rows
  - Layers can handle common keys
- Easier to source keycaps using a [[http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/104-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html][104 key donor]]
  - Fine that it isn't double-shot, deal with wear later
- Balance Fn like the other modifiers
  - Makes them easily reachable for handling all F keys
  - Fn is only used for Function keys right now, that is fine, simple
- Move Esc to its place
  - Good for VI users
- Add a layer below Fn
  - Keeping it balanced
  - Layer 1 (base is 0) most frequently used
- In the empty row in the middle, add layers
- Still an Emacs keyboard
  - Use firmware macros to input Unicode for example Greek-a would send
    - =M-x ucs-insert RET GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA=
      - Unlikely to be re-bound
    - Hex would be easier
- Layer listing
  - 0 Base
  - 1 Fn
  - 2 Balanced below Fn
  - 3-9 Middle row (balanced by location)
    - Greek
    - APL
    - Emoticons
      - Faces
      - Brackets
    - Double-Struck
      - Upper
      - Lower
  - 9 layers
    - Perhaps 10th layer can be accessed by double tap
- src_emacs-lisp{(* 6 16)} {{{results(=96=)}}} key layout
