#+TITLE: Getting Started with @dyalogapl APL on OS X for the Truly Impatient

- These are the steps that I took to get Dyalog up and running on an OS X
  10.11 box *for my first time ever*
- Dyalog is easy to set up on OS X
- These notes are the shortest specific steps that I found to get Dyalog up
  and running
- My goal is to evaluate =⍳5= using my laptop keyboard
- My notes follow

- There are four different licenses that make Dyalog accessible to every kind
  of user
- Choose a [[http://www.dyalog.com/prices-and-licences.htm][price and license]] and then follow the link to apply for a license
  | Approximate Price (USD) | License Link            | Note                  |

- Wait 5 minutes for that license and download link via email
- Read the [[http://docs.dyalog.com/14.1/Dyalog%2520APL%2520for%2520Mac%2520OS%2520Installation%2520and%2520Configuration%2520Guide.pdf][installation guide]]
- Download and install, don't run it yet
- Go to ~$HOME/.dyalog~ and initialize a Git repo and add everything and commit
  it
- Install the *fixed-width* APL385 font into =$HOME/Library/Fonts/=
- Install keyboard mapping for APL glyphs into =$HOME/Library/Keyboard Layouts=
  following the setup directions
  - The default way to switch input sources is
    - =control-<space>= previous input source
    - =control-option-space= next input source
  - Emacs will notice, so change it to
    - =option-space= previous
    - =option-shift-space= next
  - The input source is nice, glad to learn about this
- Print out the Default Keyboard page to keep on your desk
  - You can also find the layout [[https://dfns.dyalog.com/n_keyboards.htm][here]] which is nice if you want to change the
    font size or color of the printout. The APL symbols are difficult to read
    when they are in orange on white.
  - I pasted it into a text editor and made it black on white, and increased
    the font (APL385) size to 41 to fill the entire page
  - After playing around with I learned that when you print the PDF you can
    adjust the zoom to fill the entire page, so I did so
  - [[./pdf/dyalog-keyboard-fmt.pdf][Here]] is the final result
- Start Dyalog
  - Make sure that it works
  - Should be able to evaluate =⍳5= now
  - Hold =Option= and push the I key and then 5 and hit return
- Most APL examples on the Internet are IBM APL2
  - If you want to run them then [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27936301/enclose-behaviour-in-gnu-apl-and-dyalog-apl][set the compatibility level]] to 3 like this ~⎕ML←3~
- This is how I got started
  - Feel good about it
  - Have an APL distribution
    - With an APL keyboard, cool!
    - That can run most APL examples, cool!
  - Looking forward to doing more
