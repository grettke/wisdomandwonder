#+TITLE: The Anatomy of Trust by Brene Brown

http://www.supersoul.tv/supersoul-sessions/the-anatomy-of-trust

- Brene Brown on Super Soul Sunday
- Reliability
  - be aware of your limitations, don't over promise.
- Accountability
- Vault
  - holding the confidences of others
- Integrity
  - choosing courage over comfort, choosing what's right over what's fast fun
    or easy, practicing your values, not just professing them.
- Non-judgment
  - when we assign value positively to when we or others need help
- Generosity
  - take whatever words I say in the most positive kind accepting manner.
    Learn to make generous positive assumptions about what others say or
    believe.
- Common Enemy to Intimacy
  - sharing negative gossip about others.
- Self-trust
  - Can you count on yourself?
- "Follow your curiosity
  - This is much easier than following your passion.
- Curiosity is always gentle and available." -- Elizabeth Gilbert
