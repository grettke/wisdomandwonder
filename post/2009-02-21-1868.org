#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://ggww2.stanford.edu/GUS/tarskisworld/index.jsp;jsessionid=4EA26780CCE1851AB602BA7FF884EA63][The package]] is intended as a supplement to any standard logic text or for use by anyone who wants to learn the language of first order logic. The main body of the book contains a collection of exericses which use the Tarski's World software to teach the language and semantics of first order logic. The Tarski's World application allows the evaluation of first-order sentences within blocks world which users may construct using a simple editor. The worlds consist of collections of blocks of varying sizes and shapes, and placed on a checkerboard. We use an interpreted first-order language which allows users to write sentences about these worlds and evaluate their truth. A Henkin-Hintikka game may be used to elucidate the evaluation procedure.
