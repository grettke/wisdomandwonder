What I want to sell this bike for is one billion US dollars. Anyone who tells
you they want less for their bike probably doesn't think very much of it.
Well, I do.

She is in near perfect condition with barely any miles. Please know that to
get a garage queen like this with virtually every farkle in existence is a
pretty sweet /if that is what you are looking for/. And if /you/ are reading this
then you are interested. That said one billion US dollars doesn't really
reflect the market demand hahaha! (if you can't laugh then you need to ride
more)

The market demands a more realistic price so I am listing it for $3467 and
that price is open to negotiation. Rest assured that I live here and love
Milwaukee,WI and that I want to see you out riding safe and having fun with
this bike NOW (after you pick it up here). Summer has just begun so it is time
/for you/ to be out riding NOW!

Depending on where your read this please contact me by whatever is easiest for
you for example Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Craiglist or plain
old email (gcr@wisdomandwonder.com).

P.S.:

Here is a pre-thank you for everyone who shares their opinion on this bike and
it's listing price. I will take it all under immediate consideration.
