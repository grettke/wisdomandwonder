#+TITLE: Already Postive Change for R7RS

The R7RS steering committee will be updating the charter to allow for another two members in the steering committee: Olin Shivers and Chris Hanson. Two more members is a /good thing/. Additionally, the post hints that the passionate discussion on the R6RS mailing list may have payed off with changes to the process that will better represent all of the community. I look forward to what comes of this.
