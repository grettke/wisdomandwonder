#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 37: Playing with Layers

- Function keys will never be chorded to label them in front
  - Might not be worth labeling
- Labels on keys should make layer choice obvious to user
  - Don't need separate keys for each layer like Greek and APL and Smiley
    - Greeks only neeed lower case
  - Users will change them
  - Fn will hold most common
    - Maybe those will always go on front label
- TODO: ISO Greek layout, lower case in front
- TODO: Dyalog APL
  - How does GNU APL do it?
- TODO: Smileys
- Mouse, can't mirror it
