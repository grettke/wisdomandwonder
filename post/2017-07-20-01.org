#+TITLE: For Whom Do We Cry When We Leave Our Teachers?

Our teachers who we love deeply in our hearts aren't there for us to put them
in our pocket and carry around forever. But there is something that stays with
us. They gave us everything and expected nothing. They shared something
infinite with us that wasn't even theirs to share, yet they shared it. How do
you thank them for that? You can't. But you can do something thankful about
it. That is where your conscience steps in with that answer you seek.
