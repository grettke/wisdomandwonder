The PLT Scheme email list archive URLs have changed. You can read all about it in this [[http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-dev/2009-April/000540.html][thread]].

The result is that any links posted before this change was made are now broken.

Basically it is no one's fault: not the PLT folks nor the sysadmins. The mailing list software reindexes messages in this breaking manner.

Nonetheless, now there are around *200 broken links* on this site alone. I'm neither sure how to fix them automatically nor manually. Clearly the latter would be too time consuming.
