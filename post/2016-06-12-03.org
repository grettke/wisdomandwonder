is an important and
challenging book. It is important because it deals with 80% of the toughest
interpersonal aspects of a professional working environment that will pay off
dividends in every aspect of both your career and the health of the
organization. It is challenging because it explains everything by example. I
don't blame them. They tackle tough philosophical issues and make them
approachable and even actionable. This book is at least life, professional
life changing. Give it a chance. If you read it once, try it again in a three
years. You will find that the book has changed as much as you have.
