#+TITLE: Eclim: The power of Eclipse in your favorite editor

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://eclim.org/index.html][Eclim]]provides the ability to access Eclipse code editing features (code completion, searching, code validation, and many more) via the command line or a local network connection, allowing those features to be integrated with your favorite editor. Eclim provides an integration with Vim, but third party clients have been created to add eclim support to other editors as well (emacs, sublime text 2, textmate).
