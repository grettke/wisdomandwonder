#+TITLE: Companies using DSLs with Functional Programming Languages

One of the questions that has been lingering in the back of my mind for a long time is "When should a company use a DSL?". My stock answer has always been "When it makes sense."

Perhaps a better way is to answer that question is to look at /how/ companies are actually using them today, rather then to simply guess! 

Have a look at the "case studies" section in [[http://www.montages.com/presentation/20070901Stefansen.pdf][this presentation]] on ContractML to see how companies are using DSLs today.
