Here are the release notes for bloggers:

- Adds a simple and powerful user interface exposing every aspect of
  Org2Blogâ€”many of which you may never have known even existed before.
  - Use the one-keypress help menu to look up the documentation behind every
    menu entry along with the function name behind it if you want to bind it
    to a key.
- Includes the manual built-in to the application. It is the README.org so you
  don't have to go to the web page to read it.
- Expands on and revises every aspect of documentation including explanations
  and screenshots.
  - Blogging styles and strategies covered range from first-time blogging to
    advanced use with multiple blogs and diverse workflows.
- Adds an API for automating bulk import of Org files when you want to move
  from another Org based blogging platform to Org2Blog.
- Added a new logo:
  - A WordPress operator's inky hand, colored by Org mode, cradles a special
    press plate for Org2Blog: Org2Blog's first logo. Thank you Cari at
    [[http://sepiarainbow.com/][Sepia Rainbow Designs]] for this brilliant logo.
- Adds a built-in README with links to learn more about this project, how to
  start having fun blogging, and even how Free Software is critical to you as
  a user and society as a whole.
