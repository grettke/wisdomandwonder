#+TITLE: HELP: Yet Another Literate Emacs Configuration!

HELP is the culmination of everything that I've learned about literate
programming (LP) in Org-Mode—written with the intent to share it with others
in total and complete respect and consideration of you and the value of your
time. No platitude here: time /is/ precious.

With that in mind here is a breakdown of the sections you might be interested
in (and should ignore):

Here are the files that compose HELP in order of load dependency, the next one
always load the previous one. The first two configuration files are the most
reusable "out of box" parts of HELP:

- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Exemple_Complet_Minimal.org][Org-Mode Exemple Complet Minimal]] \rarr [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grettke/help/master/.org-mode-ecm.emacs.el][.org-mode-ecm.emacs.el]]
  - Proper etiquette before posting questions to the mailing list is to start
    Org with nothing else loaded to debug your issue—this is that
    configuration. It helps you create the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#ecm][Org ECM: Exemple Complet Minimal]]
  - Helper function to dump all of the information you need to include in the ECM
  - By necessity all of the *essential* Emacs configuration, though not much, is
    in there too and definitely worth taking a look at
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Fundamentals.org][Org-Mode Fundamentals]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-fundamentals.emacs.el][.org-mode-fundamentals.emacs.el]]
  - Org-Mode configuration great for the style of LP described by the table [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Org-Mode_Fundamentals.org#literate-programming][here]]
  - Individual headlines are good for reference and copy and paste too
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Package-Management.org][Package-Management.org]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-package-management.emacs.el][.org-mode-package-management.emacs.el]]
  - Package management configuration stuff
  - Safe to ignore
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/Contribute.org][Contribute.org]] \rarr [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/.org-mode-contribute.emacs.el][.org-mode-contribute.emacs.el]]
  - Loads packages that for some reason I make changes
  - Safe to ignore
- [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org][help.org]] \rarr [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grettke/help/master/.emacs.el][.emacs.el]]
  - /The/ section to skim and find parts to copy and paste
    - All of my very personal preferences.
  - Intent driven headlines that are personal favorites and maybe useful to you
    - [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org#style-guide][LP Style Guide]]
      - Writing style guard-rails
    - [[https://github.com/grettke/help/blob/master/help.org#history][History]]
      - Most of the time you see initialization files that are the result of
        years of continuous refinement and improvement—you never see the
        complete messes! The fun story about my config include the mistakes,
        confusion, and completely dropping Emacs! It is really fond memories
        for me, too.
