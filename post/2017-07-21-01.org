#+TITLE: The Half-Life Of Feelings

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life][Half-life]] is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial
value.
#+END_QUOTE

Imagine taking a banana and cutting it in half. And in half again. And in half
again and so on until you are left with invisible to you banana molecules.
That is when the banana is "gone". How long does it take for our feelings to
be gone?

Are they real? Are they physical? How long should we keep them around? If we
stop looking at them do they disappear? Do we carry them on a pedestal or
inside of a garbage bag?

For some of us the half-life of bad feelings is so long that they never seem
to go away. For others the half-life is non-existent. The bad feelings come
but don't stay very long. For some of us same goes for good feelings.

What is the nature of those feelings?
