#+TITLE: Mounting a Sparseimage with Automator in OS X

I use [[http://www.bombich.com/][Carbon Copy Cloner]] to backup the Mini to an encrypted sparse image. OS X 10.6 used to mount the image automatically but quit doing so and I can't figure out why. In lieu of that I built an Automator script to mount the share so that CCC could mount the image. That worked until upgrading to 10.7. 

My final solution was to add a final step to the script asking the user to mount the sparse image manually. 

[[http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=73808][This site]] showed how to do so like this:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
tell application "Finder" to display dialog "Empty Trash" with icon 2

#+END_EXAMPLE
