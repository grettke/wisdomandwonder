#+TITLE: ImgBurn for Windows is Excellent

[[http://www.imgburn.com/][Here]]is a great disc-burning application for MS Windows called ImgBurn. Works great "out of the box" and is free, which doesn't reflect its utility or value at all.

I will only share additionally that I've tried two free and two commercial application, which I won't name for fear of any publicity that it would generate for them, that ultimately would fail due to pretty simple scenarios like a disc not being loaded in the disc-drive.
