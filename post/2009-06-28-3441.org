#+TITLE: A Re-Imagining of Smalltalk: Pharo

[[http://www.pharo-project.org/about][Here]] is the main page for Pharo Smalltalk; it looks pretty interesting.

From talking to a Squeak maintainer; I got the impression that a lot of Squeak developers and maintainers feel sort of a love hate thing with Squeak. On the one hand it has so much history and it is such a great tool that they loathe change. On the other hand, the inability to change things is the biggest issue in moving forward.
