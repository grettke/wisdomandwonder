#+TITLE: My definition of attitude

Attitude is how you feel despite all of the logical reasons not to feel that way.

Attitude is how you feel despite what everyone else is telling you about how you /should/ be feeling right now.

Attitude means that you are taking personal responsibility and control of your life and how you feel instead of giving it away to something or someone else.
