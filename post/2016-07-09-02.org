Here is her smiling face! Can't you see yourself out this summer
sport-touring on the cheap and super-fast?!

https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_0743.jpg

This comes with her special friend: *M.U.T.T.*. That's the /monster under the
tank/. Wherever you and her go, MUTT follows. MUTT gives you /just about/
*ONE HUNDRED HORSEPOWER*; With the pleasantness and affection of any good mutt.

If you are interested in a Connie, then you already did your home work. So
did I. Save yourself some time and money and start here and start riding *now*!
