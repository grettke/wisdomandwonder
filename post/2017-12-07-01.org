#+TITLE: What Is Your transpose-[chars|words|...] Story?

I wonder because I've got no story myself. I mean I know about it but probably
don't do it frequently enough for it to occur to me to use a function.

But a lot of people do and so greatly value this function.

What is your transpose-[chars|words|...] story? What kind of things are you
transposing a lot and why?
