If you have long-running tasks you surely want to keep your Mac awake to at allow them to complete, or more. A lot of GUI applications claimed to fit the bill but the first one I tried let the Mac go to sleep! The solution is [[https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html][caffeinate]]; run it from the terminal.

*ADDENDUM*

Here is the flag for preventing the machine from sleeping, perhaps the most important one:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
-s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This asser-
             tion is valid only when system is running on AC power.

#+END_EXAMPLE
