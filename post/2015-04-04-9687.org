#+TITLE: I Wasted Time with a Custom Prompt for R with ESS

I wanted a custom prompt for R with ESS. I wanted a double struck R. I probably did it wrong. It never worked. Actually it worked most of the time, and that is worse than never working. Kind people helped me. I still got it wrong. I take full responsibility. It was better not to do it. If you want to try, here is where I left it.




*.Rprofile*







Make the ℝ prompt stand out (be sure to tell ESS how to handle this):





#+BEGIN_HTML
  <div class="org-src-container">
#+END_HTML




#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    options(prompt="ℝ> ")

#+END_EXAMPLE




#+BEGIN_HTML
  </div>
#+END_HTML






*.emacs.el*







Tell ESS how to handle my custom prompt:





#+BEGIN_HTML
  <div class="org-src-container">
#+END_HTML




#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq inferior-ess-primary-prompt "ℝ> ")

#+END_EXAMPLE




#+BEGIN_HTML
  </div>
#+END_HTML






Handle the custom ℝ prompt in =ess=. Don't use custom here.






#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq inferior-S-prompt "[]a-zA-Z0-9.[]*\\(?:[>+.] \\)*ℝ+> ")

#+END_EXAMPLE
