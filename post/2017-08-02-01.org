#+TITLE: Doing What Matters Most To You (Getting Things Done)

When you keep desperately and constantly failing to complete a task:

- And you have freed the most possible time
- And you have attained the greatest mastery for that task
- And you have received the most help you could possibly receive
- And you have prioritized everything and this remains

Then do less of everything else.

Eventually you'll be left with a list of what matters most to you. And it will
be smaller than when you had started so it might be easier to finish.
