#+TITLE: Remove .svn files recursively

Today I needed to convert a Subversion working copy (aka a checkout) into an export. Recursively blowing away all of the .svn directories in DOS (Windows XP) didn't seem to be straightforward so I ended up using UNIX find in cygwin. Here is the command:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
find . -type d -name '.svn' -exec rm -rf {} \;

#+END_EXAMPLE



The command was provided [[http://codesnippets.joyent.com/tag/svn#post1547][here]], and the following is documentation from the man page.


-  find 
  :: Execute the find command
-  . 
  :: Path in which to start
-  -type d 
  :: File is of type 'd', a directory.
-  -name '.svn'
  :: The file name on which to match, .svn.
-  -exec rm -rf {} \;
  :: Execute this command for every file that is found. The string '{}' is replaced by the current file name being processed. The semi-colon is escaped by a backslash. While reading the man page, I also found that you probably should enclose the braces in single quote marks.
