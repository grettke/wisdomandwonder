#+TITLE: What a Programmer Should Study

To paraphrase a quote attributed to Avinash Meetoo's unnamed professor in the comments section in this [[http://wiki.acm.org/cs2001/index.php?title=SIGPLAN_Proposal][wiki article]]:



#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A programmer should be studying that which prepares him for his last job; not just his next, or current one.
#+END_QUOTE
