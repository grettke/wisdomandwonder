#+TITLE: Using DrScheme to Edit Code for Any Distribution

I would like, or for someone else to, write a plugin for DrScheme that would allow it to easily call out to execute code on any Scheme distribution.

The reason is that DrScheme is a very nice cross-platform editor with great features that you can use on R5RS and R6RS Scheme source code. 

The plugin would need to be smart enough to know how to call out to another Scheme executable and disable PLT specific features. 

Based on Leppie and Eli's [[http://ironscheme.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=58838&ANCHOR#Post199547][conversation]]; it seems possible. 

Am I the only one that uses DrScheme for all of my Scheme editing?

I run code on PLT, Ikarus, Ypsilon, and Iron Scheme.
