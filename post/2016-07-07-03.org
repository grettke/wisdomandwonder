#+TITLE: Alive and Healthy: Standing Up to the Forces of the Past (Podcast 25)

Every meal-time is pure psychology.

Now is the time to develop a life style that fulfills the purpose of your
birth.

"It is a struggle to stand up to historically popular for you habit patterns".

"The river-beds of life are never more than 18" deep" so you if you dig deep
you can always get out.

Do what you should do because it is your purpose, not what pleases you, and
not what pleases someone else.

"Prayer is to find a moment where you are no longer motivated by an out of date
history or out of control ego".

Apparent consciousness; a parent of consciousness. Do what ought and needs to
be done.
