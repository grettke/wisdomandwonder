#+TITLE: Consider C-s Or M-s For Key Bindings Because There Is A Lot Of Space In There

As key-binding name-spaces start to run out due to the massive expansion of
packages out there today consider the ~C-s~ and the ~M-s~ name-spaces. Clicking
around on my keyboard they don't seem to be used much if at all. There is
probably a reason for that and I'm going to ignore it because I want more
name-space free for key-bindings.
