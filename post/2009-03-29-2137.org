#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We are delighted to announce the first release of [[http://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme/tree/master][Moby Scheme]], a compiler from Beginner Student Language (BSL) + World programs to smartphones. The current prototype compiles to the Android platform, and supports almost all BSL programs as well as libraries to accelerometer, GPS, and SMS functionality.

We are concurrently working on a Web service interface for end-users. If your only goal is to *use* Moby, you can certainly try it out, but the current release assumes you have some developer chops to install and manage packages. We're hoping, however, that you'll also want to *contribute*, for which this is your avenue.
