#+TITLE: Yoga Pants That Men Will Actually Wear

Men like wearing blue jeans or dress slacks. I do. Do they have them for Hatha
Yoga? Probably not. I couldn't find any. I found the next best thing: Thai
Fisherman Pants.

Do Thai fisherman really wear these or not. It doesn't matter because they
work. They work fine for me. I can do Hatha in them. My test subjects:  [[http://amzn.to/2iEURhv][these]]
and [[http://amzn.to/2jRD04q][these]]. Not the worlds thickest material but it is still cotton and you
can't see through any of the areas that count. Good for you and everyone else
in class.

Are they the same as the $100USD version? Probably not but I don't care. I'll
worry about that later. You probably can too.

It costs less than $20USD. You don't have to make any stressful commitments
because you spent tons of money on your Yoga clothes. Why wait?
