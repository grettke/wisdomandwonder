#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 30: Smaller Modifiers

- After 3 years using single-key modifiers on a MBP and HP laptop I can do the
  same thing here.
- USB spec defines all =F= keys so use them and see what happens
- Get rid of right side of board in the process

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Start with version 29
- Add =F13= to =F24=
- Make bottom 1 wide:
  - Because
    - They are flow interrupting actions
    - It is OK to find home with 1 key
  - Keys
    - Alt
    - Meta
    - Ctrl
    - Gui
    - Ultra
    - Shift
- Leave middle modifiers alone because they are pinky used; need to be large
- Make spacebar and enter 4 wide
  - 3 is too small
  - 4 is perfect
- Move arrows below right hyper
- Move pgup pgdn below left hyper
  - Make them 1.5w
- Move home above left arrow and end above right arrow
- Move caps lock above escape making it 1w
- Move insert and delete above backspace left
- This leaves PrSc, ScrollLock, and Pause hanging
  - Replace CapsLock with PrSc and del caps lock
  - Delete Scroll Lock and Pause
  - Make delete and insert wide
- Made F4 and F7 homing keys if it isn't obvious
