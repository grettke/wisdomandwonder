#+TITLE: Algorithmic Music via FORTH


In the comments of [[http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2008/06/forth%20timelessness-redux.html][this post]] a commentor named b0b (sic) mentioned "algorithmic music". I emailed him and he shared more information about it. That led to reading his [[http://www.fixture-records.com/b0b.html][bio]] that provides information both about the author and the composition.







b0b created music playing automatons each with the limitations that humans have. The whole thing is quite an expression of creativity!







You can listen to the record on the site and also purchase a cassette tape. 
better, the FORTH source code is available [[https://github.com/b0blee/4thAcademy][here]]!







Seems like a fine excuse to learn more about the Atari ST and ForthMacs!
