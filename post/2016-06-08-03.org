* Result

[[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10250/three-ways-to-quote-in-your-notes-with-org-mode][(Screencast) Three Ways to Quote in your Notes with Org-Mode]]

* Plan

- Demonstrate how I like to quote content in Org-Mode
- Learn how to use call-outs and text-boxes
- Learn how to ad-lib content
- Scripted out location of content and video-recording of presenter to make
  sense of what is appearing on the screen and where
- Learn how to use content-music

* Execution

- Made video top right 100% of the top right corner
  - This means scaling it by 50%
- Remove the dropshadow from the video
  - The video stood out enough already
- Amplified volume by 200%
- Added callouts interesting content
- Added watermwark, 25% scale, 25% opacity, 10 key-presses from bottom and
  right edge
- Include the word Screencast in announcement to distinguish between
  screencast and blog post
- 6h of effort for 7m of content
- Posted manually on Reddit
- Blog published to social sites

* Outcome & Feedback

- Wrote a script; didn't pay attention to it enough
- After re-recording it six times, said I would never re-record it again.
  Instead made corrections using text-boxes positioned over my face.
- Light was OK
- Speaking volume was too quiet; content volume was too loud
- Skin was shiny
- Looping the banner and jingle at the end was a mistake
- The 3m monologue about Braille displays was interesting to me and perhaps no
  one else so don't include that. 3m is a long time.
- Use a lower-third intead of text boxes
- Redditers commented that a blog post would have been more concise and
  faster. What is the best of both worlds?
