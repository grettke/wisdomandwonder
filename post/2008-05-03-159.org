#+TITLE: Why Emacs?

Emacs is a text editor built on top of a Lisp (Elisp) interpreter. The full API of the both text editor and the Lisp interpreter itself is available to the user.

For this reason, along with the fact that there are hundreds and hundreds of useful additions available to Emacs, I am learning it.

There isn't anything more to it than that!
