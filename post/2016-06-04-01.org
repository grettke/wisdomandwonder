#+TITLE: Two Easy Ways to Kill a Paper Tiger

There are two easy ways to kill a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_tiger][paper tiger]].

The quickest way is with fire. It destroys the tiger; nothing remains. Maybe
the fire gets out of control and destroys the torch-bearer, too. You never
know.

The slowest way is with water. Draw a warm bath where the tiger is safe and
gets some rest along with the opportunity to finally heal its wounds. You
might end up with a friend afterwards and you might not; and you will
definitely end up with a kitten at the end.
