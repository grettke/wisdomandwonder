#+TITLE: Best Way To Transliterate Unicode to ASCII?

For creating audio-books I use a text-to-speech engine. One problem is that the
application dies on Unicode text. The documents that I encode are too long to
correct manually so I want it automated. The correction isn't as simple as
removing all Unicode text though because if possible I don't want to lose the
meaning of the character when it is easily converted to ASCII.

For example here are some transliterations that ought to occur:
- ¢ \rarr cents
- © \rarr copyright
- ™ \rarr trademark
- ∀ \rarr for all
- ♥ \rarr heart
- ∂ \rarr derivative

I'm more concerned with not-breaking the text-to-speech engine but having a
large breadth of transliterations would be nice. With that in mind I started
looking for solutions and whittling them down to choosing one:

- Revision 1
  - PKG/URL
    - Package name
    - Github URL
  - Lang
    - Programming language
  - Str
    - Number of stars
  - Notes
- Revision 2 options. I want well supported and easy to run.
  - #C: Number of committers
  - C: Most recent commit: Hours, Days, Months, Years

The Python port looks like the most actively maintained and Python is always a
good choice. [[https://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2009/01/unicode_transliteration_in_python/][The author's discussion]] of his port is interesting for
programmers. In theory we design system that use Unicode even though we know
that they'll have to inter-operate with ASCII-only systems. In practice it is
usually an afterthought that results in well-hidden bugs and exploits. Kind of
gets you wondering whether or not we would be better off only building
ASCII-only systems today.

Here is how to get it set up with =virtualenv= on OS X and =brew=:

Review [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode][this]] and [[https://webamused.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/building-64-bit-python-python-org-using-ucs-4-on-mac-os-x-10-6-6-snow-leopard/][this]] and verify that you have a Python build with the Unicode
support for "wide" characters. For transliterating Blackboard bold, you need
this.

This code should answer 1114111 (not 65535)

#+NAME: orgmode:gcr:vela:54A7A3DB-81A1-4D79-8411-4B6459FA4E5C
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output

This is the wrong Python build. It needs to be =ucs4= instead of =ucs2=. Seems
like a fair number of people use =ucs4= ([[https://codegists.com/code/install-python-2.7-mac/][here]], [[https://codegists.com/code/install-python-2.7.9/][here]], [[http://www.jasonamyers.com/pyenv-importerror-flatnamespace][here]]).

[[https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#linux-and-os-x-ucs2-versus-ucs4][This]] explains common CFFI errors from systems with both =ucs2= and =ucs4=
installatins that are "mixed up".
