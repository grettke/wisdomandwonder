#+TITLE: Best Way To Transliterate Unicode to ASCII?

For creating audiobooks I use a text-to-speech engine. One problem is that the
application dies on Unicode text. The documents that I encode are too long to
correct manually so I want it automated. The correction isn't as simple as
removing all Unicode text though because if possible I don't want to lose the
meaning of the character when it is easily converted to ASCII.

For example here are some transliterations that ought to occur:
- ¢ \rarr cents
- © \rarr copyright
- ™ \rarr trademark
- ∀ \rarr for all
- ♥ \rarr heart
- ∂ \rarr derivative

I'm more concerned with not-breaking the text-to-speech engine but having a
large breadth of transliterations would be nice. With that in mind I started
looking for solutions:

- PKG/URL
  - Package name
  - Github URL
- Lang
  - Programming language
- Str
  - Number of stars
- Notes
