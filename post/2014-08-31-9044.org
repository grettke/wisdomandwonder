For experienced programmers, [[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/][Advanced R]] will serve you as an excellent resource
to learn about *specific* aspects of =R= in a comprehensive manner, /in addition to/
digging through the individual (and wonderful) documentation entries inside
of =R=.







Getting through the book requires experience with =R= to make sense of it, so it
may not be the best place to start. However, an experienced programmer will have
questions that /only this/ book addresses directly and easily. As such, using it 
as-needed for reference is a fine approach.
