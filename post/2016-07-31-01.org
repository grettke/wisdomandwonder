#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Salutogenesis is a term coined by Aaron Antonovsky,[1] a professor of medical
sociology. The term describes an approach focusing on factors that support
human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease. More
specifically, the "salutogenic model" is concerned with the relationship
between health, stress, and coping.
