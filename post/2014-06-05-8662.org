#+TITLE: Brutal honesty contains mostly brutality and little honesty

A popular American phrase is that someone is going to be "brutally honest" in their interaction with you. It is a code-word that means they are about to be cruel and hurtful, and mask it under the guise of doing so for you best interest. When you hear this phrases uttered, maybe just leave, and leave the brutality behind with its owner.
