#+TITLE: (Happiness) Who Do You Need To Be A Hero To?

If you have something that helps you be happy in life, and you want to share
it with the world, then you need a detailed and structured plan for making it
happen.

Put it on paper under these headings:

- Vision
- Skills
- Resources
- Incentive
- Action Plan

If any heading is a little light, then dig into it and fill it out before
moving forward.

Share it with your friends and family. Make it happen.

You might call it being a hero, or good, good friend.
