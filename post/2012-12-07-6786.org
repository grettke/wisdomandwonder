#+TITLE: CB750F: Day 06

Need to order a new fuel line, it is pretty neat because although it is now totally inflexible, it had still worked correctly. There is probably a painful metaphor hiding in there.

Took the jets out and put them in order. The idle jet has "98" written on it, the one on top (T). Before taking the idle jets out turned them to all the way in and wrote that down so I install the new ones at the correct setting. There is oxidation in the float bowls, I'm going to buy an ultrasonic cleaner and use true green on them, and put the whole rack in the dip tank next week. Used a socket for the topmost jet. The pin holding the 4th carb float didn't want to come up but was coerced eventually.

Sprayed carb cleaner in each of the jets and on the parts a little bit. Pat found the kit I need on http://vintagecb750.com/, the key was to select "Series 2"!

The right-hand grip is all rotten, pulled the tape off.

Need to order parts and an ultrasonic cleaner, too.
