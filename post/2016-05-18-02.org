#+TITLE: Choosing a Switch

- Brand
  - Go with best predictability
  - Cherry
- Model
  - Play with 8 switch types on [[http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-keycap-cherry-mx-switch-gateron-switch-o-ring-ultimate-sampler-tester-kit.html][tester]] for a couple weeks
    - Red, Black, Brown, Clear, Grey, Blue, White, Green
      - Only noted the actuation force after testing for two or three weeks
  - All felt fine
    - Linears felt great surprisingly
    - Tactile bump makes sense
      - Different the laptop because you begin the travel and then encounter
        another obstacle, keep pressing and then the key activates. They are
        two different bits of action: the energy to get the switch moving
        because of the weight and then the energy? to get it over the bump
    - Click noise interesting to add another dimension of feedback
      - Maybe also headache
  - Find that all keyboard make noise no matter what so choosing something
    that feels right
- Research
  - Switches on my laptop
    - Are not silent, but not clicky either
    - Go with something close to that
    - It takes 12 US 25 cent coins to activate the ALT key
      - Easiest one to test, a quarter can sit on it without obstacles
      - 11 will not press the key no matter how I nudge it
      - Tested 3 times
    - One of them [[https://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications][weighs]] 5.670 grams
    - Key press weight: src_emacs-lisp{(* 5.670 12)} {{{results(=68.03999999999999=)}}}
- Cherry Candidates (closest)
  - Legend
    - Color: Color
    - Switch: Cherry Switch Type
      - L, Linear
      - T, Tactile
      - TC, Tactile & Clicky
    - Act: Switch activation in grams
    - Dlt: Difference between desired actuation force of 68 grams and actual
      - Positive number means larger than desired force
      - Negative number means smaller than desired force
  - Data & Analysis
    | Color | Switch | Act | Dlt | CE |
    |-------+--------+-----+-----+----|
    | Red   | L      |  45 |  23 | F  |
    | Black | L      |  60 |   8 | T  |
    | Brown | T      |  45 |  23 | F  |
    | Clear | T      |  55 |  13 | T  |
    | Grey  | T      |  80 | -12 | T  |
    | Blue  | TC     |  50 |  18 | T  |
    | White | TC     |  65 |   3 | T  |
    | Green | TC     |  80 | -12 | T  |
  - CE: Close enough?
    - Want the actuation force as close as possible
    - If it is close enough, consider it
