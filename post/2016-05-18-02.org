#+TITLE: Choosing a Switch

- Brand
  - Go with best predictability
  - Cherry
- Model
  - Play with 8 switch types on tester for a couple weeks (with actuation
    force)
    - Red 45g, Black 60g, Brown45g, Clear 55g, Grey 80g, Blue 50g, White 65g,
      Green 80g
      - Only noted the actuation force after testing for two or three weeks
  - All felt fine
    - Linears felt great surprisingly
    - Tactile bump makes sense
      - Different the laptop because you begin the travel and then encounter
        another obstacle, keep pressing and then the key activates. They are
        two different bits of action: the energy to get the switch moving
        because of the weight and then the energy? to get it over the bump
    - Click noise interesting to add another dimension of feedback
      - Maybe also headache
  - Find that all keyboard make noise no matter what so choosing something
    that feels right
- Research
  - Switches on my laptop
    - Are not silent, but not clicky either
    - Go with something close to that
    - It takes 12 US 25 cent coins to activate the ALT key
      - 11 will not press the key no matter how I nudge it
      - Tested 3 times
    - One of them [[https://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/?action=coin_specifications][weighs]] 5.670 grams
    - Key press weight: src_emacs-lisp{(* 5.670 12)} {{{results(=68.03999999999999=)}}}
      - Round it to =68.04= grams
