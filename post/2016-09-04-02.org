#+TITLE: They Who Have Always Been There For You

Imagine your surprise when you discover that mitochondrial cells inside you do
nothing but generate energy for you to go about your day. They expect nothing.
Take care of them or not; they don't care. The only thing they care about is
setting you up for success. There are more.

[[http://aliveandhealthy.com/audio-podcasts/a-paper-cut-is-proof/][Cut your finger]] and white blood cells rush to your aid. They don't care what
you did. They don't care about your failures. They don't care what horrible
thing you did. They are there for you. They are there to help.

Your heart keeps pumping. Nobody asked it to do so. It just keeps running and
running and running, all for you.

This is true love.
