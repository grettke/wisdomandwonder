On my quest to rid my ride of rust I found the contaminants on the backrest mounts to be unacceptable. Take a look:

Sure it is not bad, but then again, it isn't good, either.

I did replace all of the rusty bolts, however, the powdercoating seems to be eaten away and what is left remaining is a layer of rust. 

Current investigating technical remediation for this that involve sandblasting and powdercoating.
