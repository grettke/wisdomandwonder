#+TITLE: The energy to become productive in a language

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I'm not doing programming for it's own sake, but because I'm trying to get my real work done and that involves writing code. I have neither the inclination nor the luxury of time to really delve down and spend three or six months learning a complex language in the hope that I'll be more productive

In the past I have said the same thing myself. This seems to be the status quo for the industry. I don't feel that way anymore, though. It was the result of a /feeling/ and not a rational thought process. Once you think about it, it doesn't really make much sense.

If we don't learn anything more than what we already know, then how will we ever get any more productive?
