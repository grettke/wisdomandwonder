#+TITLE: Bought some nice work boots

The MSF beginner's riders class that I took a month or so ago required shoes that covered the ankles and I ended up buying a pair of the Brahma Hutch II lace-less steel-toe boots from Walmart. Wearing now for a about a month I've been really impressed; they are comfortable, broke in really easily, and slip on and off pretty quickly. Perhaps the only downside for motorcycle-riding is that the steel-toe makes for awkward shifting and breaking. For that reason I'm looking at buying some real motorcycle boots pretty soon; in particular the TCX X-Five. 

All in all for only $30USD this is a really nice boot.[[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BrahmaHutchII.jpg][[[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/BrahmaHutchII-300x225.jpg]]]]
