-  Perl regex builder in emacs


   -  Read the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/ReBuilder][wiki]] and there are 2 options

   -  Best is [[https://github.com/wenbinye/emacs-pde/tree/master/lisp][this]]

   -  Roughly confirmed that is the best and newest

   -  Set up an el-get for it tonight

   -  Played around for while can't get el-get to load it

   -  I can't even load it myself


      -  Probably my fault


      

   -  Posted ticket on github page [[https://github.com/wenbinye/emacs-pde/issues/1][here]]
