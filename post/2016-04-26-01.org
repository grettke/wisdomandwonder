#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 27: Less Keys

Switch back to tenkeyless and don't need the function key.

- Right Fn should be lockable
- Enough of what I could find explains that OS X and Windows don't support
  F14-F24, so remove them
  - Made Esc do Caps Lock, too via Fn
- Should configure different switches per key
  - Space and return should use a higher strength
- I use the arrow keys a lot, even in Emacs, because I don't like keeping my
  hands in the home position all the time; a tenkeyless makes more sense
  - Don't need to be up so high, move by super
- Space bar
  - Use a lot of space, wastes it
  - 3 is too small if I center it, my thumbs are .5W too short
  - Maybe I can do 2,2,2, space return space
  - Not sure what else I'd put there
- Fn space key
  - Great idea, but goes against simplicity goal, so won't
- CapsLock
  - Don't need it
  - Can move it to right
- Added back Meh key
  - Named it CAS
    - Works on OS X and Windows
