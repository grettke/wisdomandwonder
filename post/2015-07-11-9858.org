#+TITLE: You Probably Want org-return-indent Bound to Return


Started questioning why after hitting RETURN while in lists I have to hit TAB to get indented properly. Kind of a dead giveaway that I should be return-and-indenting! Looked at =org-return= to find that it has an argument about indenting and then saw that =org-return-indent= passes it for you. With that in mind, RETURN is bound to that now.




You probably want =org-return-indent= bound to =return=. It saves a lot of actions.
