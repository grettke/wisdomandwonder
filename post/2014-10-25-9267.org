#+TITLE: Happiness vs Enjoyment


Happiness and enjoyment are easily confused because they mostly /feel/ the same.







Their major difference though seems to be the duration of the feeling and the
ease by which the state may be entered.







Happiness seems to be more long-lived while enjoyment seems to me short-lived.







Happiness seems to be mostly independent of the circumstances while enjoyment seems to
be mostly dependent upon the circumstances.







It seems like a worthwhile endeavor to explore where we invest our time, whether
it is in happiness or enjoyment, and evaluate the results of our investment.
