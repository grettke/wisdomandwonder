#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 31 and 32: Give Emacs More Logical Modifiers

- Impossible to design and fabricate a custom for a reasonable price in time
  and money
- Use a XKE-128 instead

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Rubber dome switches and caps
  - Disassembled a Dell keyboard
  - Found it had rubber dome switches (obviously, spongy)
  - Good to see and know
  - Been using them for years, and they were fine
  - Mechanical switch probably isn't required by me
- N-Key rollover
  - You could quickly hit
    - Control, Meta, Super, Hyper, Shift, j
  - If you designed the keyboard out to make it easy
  - 6 NKRO is probably fine
- You must choose a [[http://www.keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php][keycap style]]
  - DSA makes it easy to try different layouts so use that
  - Cost is a big topic
  - Maybe a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5WnKTNURL0][grab bag]] is a good option?
- If you want a lot of rows and columns then you need a microcontroller with a
  lot of connections like the [[https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html][Teensy++]]
- You must choose available key sizes
  - The design tools let you make a keycap any size which helps exploration
  - At build time you needs fabricated keycaps in that size
  - Easier to use pre-made caps
  - 3d printing caps is another option, but I don't want to do that
- Reality is that doing a custom build
  - Will require 3x iterations
  - Will cost 3x as much
  - Reviewed the [[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard#/][Ergodox EZ]] and it's not for me
    - Thoughtful ideas about OS-Hyper key
- Might be best to use the XKE-128 instead
  - Zero fabrication costs
  - Well-built body
  - Rubber-dome is OK
  - Cherry MX compatible stems
  - No way I could built for less
    - Hobby-ish
- Converting to XKE-128 follows
- Make power keys 2 wide because they are available from PI or SP
- Left align QAZ
- Make PgUp PgDn 1w
- Moved arrows to bottom right
- Added CapsLock back under right super
- Added Ultra* so had to move PgUp to each side of Enter row by shift
- Added a space down the middle to occupy 8x16

- Decided that it would be nice to have a space and return that went from C to
  M so expanded that
- Move Alt and Gui up to middle because
  - They are important modifiers
    - Alt-Tab is always two-handed, that is OK
  - Their importance doesn't overlap with Emacs modifiers so you use them in a
    cognitively different place
- PgUp PgDn go all the way left
- Didn't add back ScrollLk and Break, can add later if needed
- Swap Super and Shift
  - Muscle memory makes Shift happier as expected location
  - Makes super-shift easy negating opportunity for Super*
- Every Emacs modifier with * appended includes shift
  - Wherever it isn't easy to do by hand, and free keys
- Add Hyper* to left of hyper making it one key
  - This placement of hyper makes sense if you recall the feel of the layout
    of a typical laptop keyboard after you made CapsLock super. Using your
    thumb to go to C, M, super with your pinky, and H with your thumb again
    are natural
  - C-s and M-s are natural
  - H-s is even natural and H*-s is doable
- Ultra shift is easy now, so U* can go away
- Added Xtrm key for Emacs
  - C-M-s
  - Ultra below it
- You an go "all out" with Emacs modifiers if you like
- H* still makes sense
