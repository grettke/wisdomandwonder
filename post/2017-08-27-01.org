#+TITLE: If You Have An Org-Mode Problem Then You've Probably Got It Installed Twice

If you have an org-mode problem then you've probably got it installed twice.
Here are two examples where I always get into trouble:

- I run from source, this is impossible
  - It is possible because some package listed Org-Mode as a dependency
- I run only from the Org-Mode package
  - It is possible because some other package listed Org-Mode as a dependency
- Sometimes a reference to org-plus-contrib can shake things up because it
  "works fine for a while... and then doesn't"

The errors are usually cryptic, to the lazy like me, and not worth
investigating because they are fake errors.
