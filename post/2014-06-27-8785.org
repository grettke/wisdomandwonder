#+TITLE: Simple in-document generation with org-mode

org-mode's literate programming (Babel) functionality is amazing. The limitation in my case is me, not the tool. The power and abstraction just aren't something that you think about it for a document. While I suppose that is the whole point of LP, it does just take time for it to sink in, and experience. That said, [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-06/msg00894.html][this example]] is nice. 

Clearly generating a headline is something you may do once, and probably not very often, so would perhaps be more likely just use a macro definition. When I see how simple this is though, the idea of using macros really goes out the window because this is far easier and simpler and much more powerful. Here is a simple example:

This:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
* Code

#+name: hname
#+header: :exports none
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
"Hello, world."
#+end_src

* call_hname()[:results raw]


#+END_EXAMPLE



Produces this:


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
1 Code
══════


2 Hello, world.
═══════════════

#+END_EXAMPLE
