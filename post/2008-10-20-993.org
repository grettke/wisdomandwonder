#+TITLE: Controversial or difficult but necessary

While reading a discussion on the [[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2429][R6RS ratification]], I came upon a comment explaining that there were features under consideration that were considered to be "Controversial or difficult /but necessary/".

It is a virtuous goal towards which all of us ought to work in both our personal and professional life.
