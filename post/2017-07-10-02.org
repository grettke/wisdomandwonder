#+TITLE: The Opposite Of Afraid Isn't Fearless It Is Emboldened

Fearless is a great equalizer. It keeps its recipient humble. It draws her
back to humanity of which we are all members. The fearless still fears but she
fears less. The outcome is surprising: the fearless become emboldened and that
is surprising and inspiring.

The emboldened do what they believe is right in the face of all obstacles.
Simple but not simplistic she acts from her heart and her conscience without
compromise. No matter the gender, race, religion, country or origin or
political party (and the list goes on), fearlessness and the emboldened
conscience unite us all no matter what we face. We are in it together. Hear,
hear!
