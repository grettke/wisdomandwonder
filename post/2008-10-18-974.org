#+TITLE: Easy FTP mirroring with wget

There are a lot of tools out there for mirroring data, but sometimes you just want to do something very simple: download the latest contents of a FTP directory while leaving what you have already downloaded alone. wget supports a mirror command that provides this exact functionality. Just enter the directory where you would like to store the mirror and execute this command:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
wget --mirror [prot]://[username]:[password]@[hostname]/[directory to mirror]

#+END_EXAMPLE
