#+TITLE: A programming interview checklist

Leppie posted [[http://xacc.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/interview-checklist/][this]] great interview checklist. I'm mirroring it here so that I will always have a copy. 


-  Ask to see a portfolio, if not available online
-  Ask to see some of the code of the best/lead developer, this will be the best expectation
-  Ask to see the version control log and unit test log, dont fall for â€˜yes, we have/do that'
-  Ask that the best/lead developer be present at the interview
-  Make sure the best/lead developer is better than you, else you will be doing his job
-  Ask to see some run of the mill code, any random snippet
-  Ask them to be very precise on the responsibilities of the applied position, make them contractual
-  Ask to look at their DB structures
-  Ask to see architectural and design documentation
