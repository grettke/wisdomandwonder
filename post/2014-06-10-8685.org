#+TITLE: Finally a good programming interview question

Like all programming interview questions, [[http://programmingpraxis.com/2014/06/10/balanced-delimiters-2/][this one]] is contrived... and it is also succinct, precise, pleasant, and delightful. 

Rarely do you see all of those things in such questions!
