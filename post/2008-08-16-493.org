#+TITLE: Always act with choice

Always act with choice. The worse possible thing you can do for yourself is to perform actions begrudgingly. This trains your mind that you are no longer free to make decisions for yourself. Doing so undermines the very foundation on which your ego is built. Live free and choose your actions. 

Not every choice will be fun, but the important to always remember is that it is indeed, a choice.
