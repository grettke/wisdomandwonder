#+TITLE: (Bash) Avoid Most Bash Errors Pretty Much By Quoting Everything, And More Best Practices

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls][This page]] shows common errors that Bash programmers make. These examples are
all flawed in some way.

You will save yourself from many of these pitfalls if you simply always use
quotes and never use WordSplitting for any reason! Word splitting is a broken
legacy misfeature inherited from the Bourne shell that's stuck on by default
if you don't quote expansions. The vast majority of pitfalls are in some way
related to unquoted expansions, and the ensuing word splitting and globbing
that result.
#+END_QUOTE

All of us have fallen into one of these pits.

Why not use Python instead? :)

Oh yea, ~non-interactive shells~ ðŸ˜ .
