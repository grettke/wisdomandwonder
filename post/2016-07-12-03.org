#+TITLE: The Normalcy Of Misery

"I look forward to spending time with my friends so that we can catch up and
tell each other how horrible
- We are
- Our family is
- Our friends are
- Our co-workers are
- Our employer is
- Our nation is
- Is the entire race of human beings"
... *SAID NO ONE EVER*

Take a five breaths and hear them out. Maybe that is what they want to
say; maybe not. Ask them to tell you more. Reply "Gotcha...and...?"; sometimes
it works wonders. "Gotcha... you are a horrible person and are we still going
to the concert this Friday?". "And" turns the topics from a roadblock into a
speed bump; you can still go somewhere with it. Better to move forward then
sit in the muck of bad ideas that probably aren't even true.
