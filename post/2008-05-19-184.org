This presentation at JavaOne 08 could have been called "Features in Java 7 that people will love and wonder why it took so long to get them".

The topic was [[http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=277][JSR-277]]: The Java Module System. 

Here is the 20K foot summary:



-  Give modules (roughly jars) first class language support
-  Provide support for module composition at deployment time



The result: no more Jar (aka DLL) hell and a lot of flexibility in terms of how you configure and deploy your system.
