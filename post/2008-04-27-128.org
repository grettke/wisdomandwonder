#+TITLE: Live Coding with Fluxus

[[http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/][Fluxus]] is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding][live coding]] system built on [[http://www.plt-scheme.org/][PLT Scheme]].



#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  
Fluxus reads live audio or OSC network messages which can be used as a source of animation data for realtime performances or installations. Keyboard or mouse input can also be read for games development, and a physics engine is included for realtime simulations of rigid body dynamics.

#+END_QUOTE



Fluxus is a very cool system and the maintainer Dave is a very nice guy. Be sure to check it out!

*Addendum: 8/14/8*

Dave posted some links to videos of [[http://blip.tv/file/921513][fluxus]] and the [[http://www.vimeo.com/694298][no copy paste]] jam.
