#+TITLE: Samsung Galaxy S3 Will Not Obtain IP Address

My Samsung Galaxy S3 refuses to retain it's DHCP assigned IP address. The [[http://androidforums.com/threads/obtaining-ip-address-problem.610480/][first post]] talked about [[https://superuser.com/questions/258151/how-do-i-check-what-dns-server-im-using-on-mac-os-x][this solution]]. Set up your phone manually, statically, on your network. 

The key was to keep letting the router assign that IP address using DHCP; even when filtering by MAC address is turned off and the phone is set up statically!
