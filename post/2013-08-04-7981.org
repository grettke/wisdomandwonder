A generous biker let me take this 1982 CB750F motor off of his hands for free (sure his wife didn't mind either). Only 20K miles on it. Now looking for a free frame and wheels.

As it turns out, a $29USD Walmart plastic container /will/ hold an engine, and it won't fall out of the bottom; that was very convenient!
