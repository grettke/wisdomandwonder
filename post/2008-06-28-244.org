#+TITLE: OLPC XO OS build 703 changes

OLPC XO OS [[http://download.laptop.org/xo-1/os/official/703/jffs2/][build 703]] has at least [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Update.1_Software_Release_Notes][two significant changes]]:

The first is that it automatically suspend when closed, with [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Suspend_and_resume][this caveat]]:



#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  the system can't suspend when the USB bus is in use by an external device (unless it's a USB mass storage device and has been fully allowed to write any cached info and quiesce itself).
#+END_QUOTE



This might not seem like a big deal, but folks have been wanting it for a long time.

The second is that activities no longer come pre-installed in the OS image.
