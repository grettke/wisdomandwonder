#+TITLE: KEYR8 (Emacs Friendly Keyboard): Prototype Fabricated

[[http://vmetalsfab.com/][VMETALS ROCKS!!!]]

They took a newbie like me through the process of designing the thing and it
was fun. Then they fabricated the thing and it rocks.

Emacs friends: there is enough key-space (128 keys) to easily place

- Control
- Meta
- Super
- Hyper
- Ultra (Control-Meta-Super-Hyper)
- Alt
- Gui

*ON EACH SIDE OF THE KEYBOARD*

Strong thumb proponents: I'm trying to make it happen here by placing
everything on the bottom two rows (including space, Fn, and enter).
