#+TITLE: What Are The Limits Of What This Reality May Teach Us?

I thought that I could find God somewhere in this post [1][2], and other explorations, but in retrospect I was woefully wrong.

I thought that since our universe was created by God, that we could spiritually benefit from understanding it in all of its aspects, but was wrong here, too.

When I pick apart the fundamental natures of our current reality [3]: namely space, time, and causality, the Y Combinator is revealed instead to be, an artifact that *MUST OCCUR*, by definition of this reality, and not something that brings you closer to God per se.

All of the mathematical constants [4] are similarly are as they must be, in this current configuration of reality, because that is in fact their only option, without any implications beyond that.
