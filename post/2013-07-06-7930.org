#+TITLE: Rush 2013 Clockwork Angels Tour

It felt good to have Rush share with us their artistic contribution "Clockwork Angels". They are not living in the past, and how could they, nobody would keep showing up just to hear Tom Sawyer would they? That said, it was great to hear the 2112 Overture performed by it's creators ;).

Though it wouldn't look it, the [[http://marcusamp.com/][Marcus Amphitheater]] sounded great. There was great sound, you could hear everyone; certainly not what you would expect staring up at the 1.5 story tall P.A. system hanging above the stage.

The show was a blast and the guys are indeed masters.
