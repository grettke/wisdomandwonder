#+TITLE: Visiting the iPhone Dev SDK Forums

The [[http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/][iPhone Dev SDK Forums]] are just that; a collection of forums whose topics of discussion encompass just about every aspect of working in this market. Specific forum focuses range from low-level details of APIs and tooling to business topics like how best to market and support your product. 

Having spent about an hour clicking around there; I got the impression that it was a pleasant community and look forward to spending more time there.
