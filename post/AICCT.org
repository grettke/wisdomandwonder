  presses can't press up to the edge so you print to a larger sheet of paper
  that is cut down to the desired size. The bleed is the addition to the page

  - Combination of casual conversation light-heartedness and serious philosophy
    about workflow and cognitive space
- Goal: Only work on the butterfly
  - Accidentally select something else, move the wrong thing, undo it
  - Instead lock the background to avoid the accident
- Approaches
  - Background is in a group, so select it, and lock it
  - You can manipulate every other object
  - Unlock when done
- Easier way
  - Everything is in one layer right now, wrong approach, should use separate layers
  - In this example you open the layer and lock the individual groups
  - Can also hide them
  - Show and hide layers and groups
  - Even though you have everything in one layer, you can still do what you
