- When your destination is a printing-press if you want graphics printed up to
  the edge of the final size of the paper you need to consider that printing
  presses can't press up to the edge so you print to a larger sheet of paper
  that is cut down to the desired size. The bleed is the addition to the page
  size that will be cut down from.

- Teacher

  - Combination of casual conversation light-heartedness and serious philosophy
    about workflow and cognitive space
- Goal: Only work on the butterfly
  - Accidentally select something else, move the wrong thing, undo it
  - Instead lock the background to avoid the accident
- Approaches
  - Background is in a group, so select it, and lock it
  - You can manipulate every other object
  - Unlock when done
- Easier way
  - Everything is in one layer right now, wrong approach, should use separate layers
  - In this example you open the layer and lock the individual groups
  - Can also hide them
  - Show and hide layers and groups
  - Even though you have everything in one layer, you can still do what you

    - How to deal with each logical keycap layer having it's own font?
  - Lets you move individual objects keeping them in their group
- A group of groups of objects is a nest
- Select one group, shift-click another group, now you can group those two groups
- This seems to be one way to keep everything positioned correctly
- Each time you click a nest it cycles through selecting all of the groups
  - Group logically related features as their own groups so that you can dig
    deeper and deeper as you would expect
- Double-clicking objects in a nest access isolation groups which cycles
  through the nested groups
- Either way when you are in a particular group, the edit menu operates on the
  objects in that group. So Edit \rarr Select All selects everything in that
  group. Obvious but news to me.
- Just noticed in the top area that it also shows the groups including the one
  that you are in right now
- How long do groups live?

  - Get to know these program!
- Select an entire groups
  - Command-Click it to select it all showing the bounding box
  - Keep holding Command
  - Resize it however you want
  - Hold Command-Shift to keep it in proportion
  - Hold Command-Option-Shift to resize it in proportion staying centered
    - Remove the Shift key and it will still remain centered
  - Holding Shift on rotation gives you 45\deg and 90\deg shifts
- If you either have the bounding box of or want more precision you can do the
  same thing with the Scale Tool
  - Select the object (or group)
  - Select Scale Tool =S=
  - Click the point where you want to lock the object and a crosshairs will
    appear there
    - Hold Alt and click to show the Scale modifier panel with detailed options
  - Select the object/group with no modifier and now you will resize it
    relative to that point
    - Unsure how to rotate it
  - =X=, =Y=, and =W= in the top-middle section also bring up the Transform panel
- The transform panel is where you would do precise transformations like
  - Change the width and hide by specific percentages
  - Rotate it by specific degrees
