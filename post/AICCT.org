  the edge of the final size of the paper you need to consider that printing
  presses can't press up to the edge so you print to a larger sheet of paper
  that is cut down to the desired size. The bleed is the addition to the page
  size that will be cut down from.

  - Combination of casual conversation light-heartedness and serious philosophy
    about workflow and cognitive space
- Goal: Only work on the butterfly
  - Accidentally select something else, move the wrong thing, undo it

- Approaches
  - Background is in a group, so select it, and lock it
  - You can manipulate every other object
  - Unlock when done
- Easier way
  - Everything is in one layer right now, wrong approach, should use separate layers
  - In this example you open the layer and lock the individual groups
  - Can also hide them

    - How to deal with each logical keycap layer having it's own font?
  - Lets you move individual objects keeping them in their group
- A group of groups of objects is a nest
- Select one group, shift-click another group, now you can group those two groups
- This seems to be one way to keep everything positioned correctly
- Each time you click a nest it cycles through selecting all of the groups
  - Group logically related features as their own groups so that you can dig
    deeper and deeper as you would expect
- Double-clicking objects in a nest access isolation groups which cycles
  through the nested groups
- Either way when you are in a particular group, the edit menu operates on the
  objects in that group. So Edit \rarr Select All selects everything in that
  group. Obvious but news to me.
- Just noticed in the top area that it also shows the groups including the one
  that you are in right now
- How long do groups live?
