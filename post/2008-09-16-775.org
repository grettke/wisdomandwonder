#+TITLE: Packed Binary Routines for PLT Scheme 

Per [[http://drschemer.blogspot.com/2008/09/packed-binary-routines-for-plt-scheme.html][Doug's post]]:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  
I have implemented an equivalent of the Python pack/unpack functions in PLT Scheme. I needed it primarily to be able to (more easily) read binary data from other applications for analysis in PLT Scheme.

Here is what it does:


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  
This module performs conversions between PLT Scheme values and C structs represented as PLT Scheme byte strings. It uses format strings (explained below) as compact descriptions of the layout of the C structs and the intended conversion to/from PLT Scheme values. This can be used in handling binary data stored in files or from network connections, among other sources.
