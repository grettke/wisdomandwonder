#+TITLE: How Small Can a Scheme Implementation Be?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  
How small does it have to be? Chibi Scheme does syntax-rules in 174 lines of Scheme, layered over explicit renaming. Indeed, Chibi does essentially all of R5RS in 4822 lines of C + 708 lines of Scheme.

[[http://www.t3x.org/s9fes/][Scheme 9 from Empty Space]] is also very small from what Nils said.
