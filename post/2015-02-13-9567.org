#+TITLE: How to Handle and Large Slow Org Files

When some of us open large Org mode files, Emacs becomes nearly unresponsive, and nearly unusable. My stock advice has always been to call =#+STARTUP: showeverything= or do a binary search more or less to figure out which package is stomping Emacs. In this [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-02/msg00352.html][post]], though, Puneeth explains that the issue may go away entirely for some of us.
