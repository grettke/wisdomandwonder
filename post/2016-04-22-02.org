- Thoughts and changes from 19 follow
- Nearly everything interesting I want to do with the keyboard I can do in
  Emacs
  - Emacs runs everywhere I care about
  - Emacs handles USB HID keyboard correctly, use that
  - Save time: don't have to program layout for OS X and Windows
- Keep modifiers near center
  - Look weird having duplicates, but it will put more space between home
    position. Curious if it provides any comfort.
- Keep space *and* return large and easy to hit
- Keep shift near the pinky
  - Goes against original goals
  - Power of familiarity override
  - Can still claw-crab it
- Page and row navigation are placed somewhat randomly, and I still like it
  because the navigation keys are still close together
  - Tab couldn't go any higher
- Backspace and delete are nice, looking forward to trying that
- There are more two-handed operations
  - That is OK because they are strong-finger operations
  - Stays true to thumb-index-middle goal
- I'll configure Greek and APL bindings inside of Emacs
  - Might get keycaps with them listed
  - Won't implement in hardware/os though
- Layout occupies 8x16
  - All keys are used
  - Not a good goal in and of itself
  - Turned out that layout makes sense because backspace and delete are
    important. If they were one-key operations, tab too, I could remove 2
    columns from this layout.
- Can I buy 3 wide keys anywhere?
