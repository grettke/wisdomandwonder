  [[http://code.google.com/p/ypsilon/][ypsilon]] is the implementation of Scheme Programming Language, which conforms to the latest standard R6RS. It achieves a remarkably short GC pause time and the best performance in parallel execution as it implements "mostly concurrent garbage collection", which is optimized for the multi-core CPU system.

If you are wondering "Why yet another Scheme implementation" you can find the answer [[http://www.littlewingpinball.com/contents/en/ypsilon.html][here]]. To sum it up: they require real-time processing speed and can not use Boehm Garbage Collector because they run on arcade consoles or pinball machines, so, they had to start from scratch.
