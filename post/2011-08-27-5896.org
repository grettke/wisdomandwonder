  The [[http://www.sdss.org/][Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) is one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy. Over eight years of operations (SDSS-I, 2000-2005; SDSS-II, 2005-2008), it obtained deep, multi-color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars.

It is hard not to dream about exploring space when you see what Sloan has to offer.
