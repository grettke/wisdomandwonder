location there are places to hang out on certain frequencies. For example here
are some of them [[https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/prox_result.php?city=Milwaukee%252C+WI&distance=25&Dunit=m&band=%2525&freq=&call=&features=&status_id=%2525&use=%2525&order=%2560state_id%2560%252C+%2560loc%2560%252C+%2560call%2560+ASC][around Milwaukee Wisconsin]]. The trouble is that wherever you
go those places will change and it is hassle to program your handheld to know
about them. Fortunately it can be done easily:
