#+TITLE: Virtual Gravel Rash

Tonight after removing some of the caked-on dust from under the seat, I decided to investigate the gravel rash on the right of the lower fairing of the bike. 

Getting down on my hands and knees to take a look, expecting deep grooves, I was shocked to instead find something like silver paint stuck to the fairing. It was caked on there, maybe one or two millimeters. Using a damp paper towel though I was able to remove all of the shiny crud.

My best guess is that the previous owner rode into something, or something rode into him, that left the material there.

I like easy fixes!
