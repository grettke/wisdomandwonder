[[http://www.python.org/][Python]] and [[http://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]] look interesting in how they empower you to work with the web. I was reading some interesting points about both [[http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2009-03-20.html][here]] (the one interesting part about Python is that you might not need to know it in order to appreciate Django).
