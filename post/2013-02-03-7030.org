#+TITLE: CB750F: Day 10

Back to class again. This time it is only twice a week but for 4.5 hours. The majority of the evening was spent taking the rack of carbs apart. Not much to screw up here, but I always find a way. Most of the screws were stuck and/or stripped out, so Brian helped me with the last one using just a pliers. Arriving late to class, that is all I got done.

Most of these photos are for my reference later. In particular the spring locations are important.

For directions I'm using the Honda service manual, [[http://www.motorcycleproject.com/motorcycle/text/booknook.html][Mike Nixon's guide]], [[http://www.cb750c.com/publicdocs/SeanG/Honda_Carb_Manual_revD.pdf][MacGregor Carb Cleaning Services guide]], and [[http://randakks.com/collections/honda-dohc4/products/randakks-own-dohc-four-master-carb-overhaul-kit][Randakk's]] rebuild kit.
