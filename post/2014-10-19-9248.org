#+TITLE: Cleaning Up Your Messes

There is a camper's philosophy that "one should should leave the area cleaner than the state in which it was found". 

That is a beautiful philosophy because it doesn't matter who made the mess, as the fact remains that the mess must be cleaned up.

Unless legal action is required, perhaps it is not even worth asking the question "Who made the mess?" and instead utilizing all resources to clean up the mess.
