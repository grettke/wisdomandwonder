Trying to set up a dev mode in Emacs on Windows today, the code complained that $SHELL was not defined. Not sure what to use I guessed and used 'cmd'. 

At startup, that is startup, not runtime, Emacs gave me this warning:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Warning! The $SHELL environment variable uses cmd.
You probably want to change it so that it uses cmdproxy.exe instead.

Warning! shell-file-name uses cmd.
You probably want to change it so that it uses cmdproxy.exe instead.

Warning! shell-command-switch is "-c".
You should set this to "/c" when using a system shell.

Warning! w32-quote-process-args is t.
You should set this to nil when using a system shell.

#+END_EXAMPLE



Bless you Emacs! 'cmdproxy' worked perfectly.
