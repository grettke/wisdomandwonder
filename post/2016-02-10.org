#+TITLE: Switch to nlinum Immediately

/A lot/ of headings in your Org-Mode file can make Emacs unusably slow when you
collapse all of them.

My original solution was to avoid collapsing them with =#+STARTUP: showeverything=.
Major problem with that approach is that you still can't use collapsing because
if you do, Emacs because again unusable.

Months ago I switched to [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/nlinum.html][nlinum]] and now there are no more performance issues,
even on the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grettke/help/master/help.org][largest file]] that I work on.
