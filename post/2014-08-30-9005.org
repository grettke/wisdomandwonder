#+TITLE: Ultra-lightweight-reproducibility for R: which version of R that you used


Here is another post from the realm of ultra-lightweight-reproducibility for R:







If are going to get serious about locking down your system then only let it run
on the version of =R= that /you personally used/ to obtain your results!







It takes very, very little effort:






#+BEGIN_HTML
  <div class="org-src-container">
#+END_HTML




#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    stopifnot(R.version$major==3 && R.version$minor==1.1)

#+END_EXAMPLE




#+BEGIN_HTML
  </div>
#+END_HTML






99% of the time, using a newer version won't matter, but make it crystal clear
both to yourself and your collaborators how you obtained your results, at least
when it comes to which version of =R= that you used.
