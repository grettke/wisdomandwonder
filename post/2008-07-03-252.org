#+TITLE: The 90 Minute Scheme to C compiler

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  90 minute video presentation from Marc Feeley, along with accompanying PowerPoint slides and source code, for a [[http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eboucherd/mslug/meetings/20041020/minutes-en.html][Scheme to C]] compiler. Good discussion of continuations and closures, as well as some dipping into the area of compiler construction.

I didn't work through this but it looks like it might be a fun project to undertake (I'll add it to the list).
