@coriolissystems [[https://coriolis-systems.com/iPartition/][iPartition]] makes partition management on OS X a happy dream.

It does only what you expect.

If you have worked with OS X's =Disk Utility= enough you know how unpredictable
it can be. I don't know why it is that way, but you do have to be careful and
thoughtful even if you are in iPartition. I suppose that it has to do with the
OS and neither of the tools.

I just know that iPartition makes it trivially easy to resize and recreate
partitions and on OS X 10.11 it is impossible to do so with Disk Utility!
