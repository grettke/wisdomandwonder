#+TITLE: An image viewer for the XO

[[http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/wiki/FehFeatures][Feh]] is the only image viewer that is both easy to install and use on the XO. 

I never thought I would use the XO as an image viewer until I found how convenient it was to pass around to folks in lieu of a much larger laptop.
