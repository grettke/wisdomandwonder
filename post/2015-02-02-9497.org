[[http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/azure-bigpicture][Windows Azure: The Big Picture]].

You won't view anything in this video and say "Oh my goodness I never imagined you could do that with a computer". What will happen though is that now you will know how Azure lets you do that with a computer, all of their offerings from virtualization to networking to message queues covered. That is great to know. I chose this video specifically because it is the shortest. Further digging is required.
