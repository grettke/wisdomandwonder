#+TITLE: Whalesong: a Racket to JavaScript compiler

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://hashcollision.org/whalesong/][Whalesong]] is a compiler from Racket to JavaScript; it takes Racket programs and translates them so that they can run stand-alone on a user's web browser. It should allow Racket programs to run with (hopefully!) little modification, and provide access through the foreign-function interface to native JavaScript APIs. The included runtime library supports the numeric tower, an image library, and a framework to program the web in functional event-driven style.
