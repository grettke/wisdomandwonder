#+TITLE: Prototype Your Keyboard Layout First

[[http://olkb.com/planck/][Ortho-Linear]] [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/humble_hacker_keyboards.html][keyboards]] are great. Before laying down the cash it would be nice
to see how it feels. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][All of the]] [[http://colemak.com/][different]] [[http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/][layouts]] look interesting too. It
would be nice to easily try them out with a new layer or something. It seems
like there might be a nice option.

The easiest way to try it out might be using a reprogrammable grid keyboard.

I wanted the following:

- (Model): And URL
- (R&C) Lots of rows and columns
  - Love single keypress to do things
  - Want it wide enough to serve as a split-keyboard, without splitting
- ($) is available for purchase in USD
- Re(P)ly: Sales/company replies to emails
- (R)eprogrammable
  - Conveniently
- (C)ross Platform
  - Works on OS X and Windows
- (K)eycaps and switches are likable
- (Note): Anything

I found:

| Model          |  R&C | $ | P | R | C | K         | Note                   |
