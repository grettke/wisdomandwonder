#+TITLE: Prototype Your Keyboard Layout First: X-keys XKE-128

[[http://olkb.com/planck/][Ortho-Linear]] [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/humble_hacker_keyboards.html][keyboards]] are great. Before laying down the cash it would be nice
to see how it feels. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard][All of the]] [[http://colemak.com/][different]] [[http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/][layouts]] look interesting too. It
would be nice to easily try them out with a new layer or something. It seems
like there might be a nice option.

** Research
The easiest way to try it out might be using a reprogrammable grid keyboard.

I wanted the following:

- (Model): And URL
- (R&C) Lots of rows and columns
  - Love single keypress to do things
  - Want it wide enough to serve as a split-keyboard, without splitting
- ($) is available for purchase in USD
- Re(P)ly: Sales/company replies to emails
  - Don't make it a challenge just to buy it
- (R)eprogrammable
  - Conveniently
- (C)ross Platform
  - Works on OS X and Windows
- (K)eycaps and switches are likable
- (Note): Anything

I found:

** Observations

DigitPos, Access-IS never replied so they are out.

Expertkeys is out because I can't easily buy it.

Cherry has been awesome throughout. They are likable in every regard. I want
new keycaps though, so it is not an option. Too bad because 100 is a great
price.

P.I. Engineering seems to rock by every asessment I made.

    - Hardware Mode -- the X-keys simply sends native USB commands to the OS
    - Software Mode with MacroWorks Software -- the X-keys sends SPLAT
      Messages to the HID driver and MacroWorks translates them into the
      desired response such as a keystroke, mouse, or other action
    - Software Mode with a Custom Application -- the X-keys sends SPLAT
      Messages to the HID driver and a developer translates them into the
      desired response within the application

** Closing

Elisp let's you fail fast and find what is right. It should be the same with
designing keyboard layouts.

The XKE-128
- Is inexpensive
  - $500USD versus crating the PCB and case and firmware yourself
$500USD seems cheaper and faster then building a new 8x16 keyboard from
scratch. For prototyping it would be great
- Is flexible
  - 8x16 gives you penty of wiggle room
- Is supportable
  - Great team
  - Great timing
- Is cross-platform
  - Hardware support if you want it
  - OS level if you want more
