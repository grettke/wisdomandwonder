#+TITLE: Ease Is Your Natural Emotional State

Is /courageous/ exhausting? Is /kindness/ exhausting? Is /creativity/ exhausting?

/Ease/ is your natural state. You were born with it. You were sent to Earth with

/Exhaustion/ is an alarm blaring out to you as you drift away from your natural
state.

It is /never/ too late to hear it and do something about it immediately.
