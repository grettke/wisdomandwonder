#+TITLE: What is Study-HTDP?

[[http://groups.google.com/group/study-htdp][Study-HTDP]] is a study group for folks who want to read through [[http://www.htdp.org][HTDP]]. My rationale is explained [[http://groups.google.com/group/study-htdp/browse_thread/thread/5ffa6ad4aca5f406][here]]. I suspect that many blog posts in the following months will be tagged with 'Study-HTDP'.

I'm pretty excited to see how this turns out. I hope not only to learn a lot about programming, but also about learning with other folks, especially with this distributed/online model.
