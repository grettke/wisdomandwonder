#+TITLE: How to print a PLT Slideshow to a file

Here is how to print a [[http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/slideshow/][PLT Slideshow]] to a file:

=slideshow -P -c -o [output file] [input file]=



-  -P: print to postscript
-  -c: (condense) flatten the output file in the case that you had built slides incrementally



*Addendum: 05/17/08*

The 'ps' argument doesn't seem to work. I must have used the alternate 'P' originally for printing, but posted the /other/ option, 'ps'. As such, I've updated this post. I will look into this. Additionally I've changed the condense argument to 'c'.
