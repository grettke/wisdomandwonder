Lot of posts recently about the desire to reduce [[http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html][RSI]] from too much keyboard use in Emacs. Although I didn't look up any studies or evidence of this, the idea of hacking how to handle keybindings in Emacs is always interesting. 

[[https://github.com/chrisdone/god-mode][God mode]] is one way to "simplify" things.

Basically you go in and out of the mode, and when in it, single key strokes are automatically prefaced with a control, and meta commands are prefaced with a g instead.
