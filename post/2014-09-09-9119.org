#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://shop.himalayaninstitute.org/products/celestial-song-gobind-geet][Celestial Song of the Gobind Geet]] is the dialogue between Sri Guru Gobind Singh and Banda Singh Bahadur, two great leaders in the history of humanity and the Sikh tradition. This poetic interchange presents the ideals of Sikh dharma in a simple and lucid way so that they can be enjoyed, understood, and applied by all who hear them. A central theme of the book is that the spiritually aware have a responsibility to help those in the world - that selfless service to humanity is, in fact, a spiritual practice. To serve, to remember, and to love are the three essential aspects of the Sikh dharma.
