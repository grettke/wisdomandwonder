  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This document is only part of the full documentation set for Dyalog
  (available to download from http://docs.dyalog.com). In cases where the
  information given is different between this document and any of the others,
  this document should be regarded as the definitive source for Dyalog for Mac
  OS.
  #+END_QUOTE
- Maybe I should have done the [[http://tutorial.dyalog.com/][tutorial]] before reading this?!
  - Feel like getting comfortable with Dyalog means getting comfortable with
    the tooling
