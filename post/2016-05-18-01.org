  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This document is only part of the full documentation set for Dyalog
  (available to download from http://docs.dyalog.com). In cases where the
  information given is different between this document and any of the others,
  this document should be regarded as the definitive source for Dyalog for Mac
  OS.

- Maybe I should have done the [[http://tutorial.dyalog.com/][tutorial]] before reading this?!
  - Feel like getting comfortable with Dyalog means getting comfortable with
    the tooling
- Page 6
- 14.1 is brand new for OS X and it uses the new IDE which is catching up to
  the Windows IDE
- Page 7
- When I start Dyalog, the APL key mapping isn't enabled
- "Hide" and "Show" feature, neat!
- Why does =(<LBR>)= give an error? Is that a key code?
- Page 9-12
- Page 13
- Trying to edit =+= and failing on each of the four ways to do it
- Tried again, =X‚Üê10=, now all 4 options work
  - <ED> means edit, bound to =shift-enter=
- Page 14
- "is for" instead of "if for"
- Changed =X= to =20= and tried saving it, it doesn't save
