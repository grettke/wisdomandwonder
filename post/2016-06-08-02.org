* Result

[[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10223/hello-screenflow-and-youtube][Hello, Screenflow and Youtube]]

* Plan

- Develop a jingle and banner to introduce the videos
- Learn how to use ScreenFlow on smallest project possible
- Learn how to publish and monetize on YouTube
- Learn how to define closed-caption content

* Outcome & Feedback

- YouTube
  - Easy and pleasant process
  - Signing up takes 30m or so
  - Publishing the video offers 20-30 configuration options
- Forgot to develop a watermark for the videos
- Closed-captioning is tedious and time-consuming
- Screenflow project is large; be sure to keep it on a large disk
- Glad to have worked in a simple project like this to get some practice with
  Screenflow. It took some trial and error to grok the power of layers /in
  practice/.
- Volume wasn't loud enough
- Transitions were OK; can see some blockiness because of how I layered the
  background
