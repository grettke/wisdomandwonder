#+TITLE: The Light Shines

Searched for information about the phrase "The light shines" and ended up [[http://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm][here]]. There are many ways to express the idea. To put is how my teacher did: "The light has never seen darkness".

While searching I also ended up on this article: [[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/found-universe-brighter-300-trillion-suns-180955382/?no-ist][A Galaxy That Shines With the Light of Over 300 Trillion Suns]].
