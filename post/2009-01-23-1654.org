#+TITLE: How many kinds of Schemers are there?

Since the beginning of my study of Scheme I have tried to understand the community. What I have found is that if one had to define a single trait by which you could make a classification it would come down to whether or not they wanted more than what [[http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/][R5RS]] defines, or not. A few days ago in this [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/msg/4c8f927197dac41e][thread]] on comp.lang.scheme, a poster elaborated on this:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
1. People who prefer R5RS, and think it should not have been extended. 
(Felix Winkelmann, maintainer of Chicken) 
2. People who like R5RS, dislike R6RS, but think a better standard for 
Scheme is possible (Will Clinger, maintainer of Larceny) 
3. People who use R6RS as their primary language (Aziz Ghoulum, 
maintainer of Ikarus) 
4. People who use a particular Scheme implementation (myself, using 
PLT)

#+END_EXAMPLE



As he pointed out, that is a non-exhaustive list. A question for the reader:

"What is missing?"
