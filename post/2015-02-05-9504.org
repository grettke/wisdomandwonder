#+TITLE: Elmacro Shows Keyboard Macros or Latest Interactive Commands As Emacs Lisp

[[https://github.com/Silex/elmacro][elmacro]] shows keyboard macros or latest interactive commands as emacs lisp.

This package might pique your curiosity. Surely everyone has wondered how to do something like this, especially if you use the macro recorder a lot.

While I don't have an immediate need for it, I look forward to being able to address it with this package.
