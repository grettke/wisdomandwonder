While reading [[http://albertskblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/useful-latex-preambles.html][this]] article, it occurred to me that one ought to approach LaTeX coding much as one would code in any other language: re-use whenever possible. 

Aspiring TeXnicians should get comfortable with searching for packages that contain the desired functionality, and using them, rather than starting from scratch each time.

Perhaps this is something of a no-brainer, but, it is very easy to get caught up in the fact that you are writing, rather then coding, while using LaTeX.
