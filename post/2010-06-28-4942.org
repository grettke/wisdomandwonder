#+TITLE: I love my M.U.T.T.

Last Friday I took my first real ride on the bike. It was a lot of fun. Riding a bike with a 10k redline was also a new experience for me which made it fun. Honestly, it was sort of shocking to me, the engine seemed to have 3 moods:


1. Meditating
2. Purring
3. Roaring!



I [[http://micapeak.com/archives/cog/msg67809.html][wondered]] where the engine should live for normal cruising, and Dale [[http://micapeak.com/archives/cog/msg67817.html][explained]]that where it seems happy, it is happy. Great. I can't wait to get back out again to spend some time with my M.U.T.T. Who is M.U.T.T?
