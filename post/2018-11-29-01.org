#+TITLE: How To Choose The Perfect Emoticon

Emoticons are pretty fun to use but they are hard to choose because there are
so many!

Here is how to make it easy: go over this list and then use /search/ to find the
noun or verb that you are looking for like "triumph" or "savouring" or "unamused"

Even if you don't have anything to search for, it is still in alphabetical
order and it is pretty fun to see all eighty faces out there available right now!

*Addendum 2019-02-03*

Just learned that there is a difference between
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji][Emoticons]] (aka /Emoji/) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode][Unicode characters]]. The difference comes down to
whether or not your operating system understands what to do with it. Even if
you have a font that /can/ display the character, it is up to the operating
system whether it will show it to you or not. For example in macOS, it will
display the "SUPERHERO" 🦸 character in TextEdit, but not in WhatsApp. That
choice by the operating system seems to be the difference between the two.
Whatever the case, all of the characters listed here are plain old Unicode
characters that will display everywhere you've got a font that includes them.
