#+TITLE: Do Looks Matter?

After posting [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/5514/new-genmar-riser-caps][this]] it got me thinking about a conversation I had with one of my friends. He argued that how a bike looks doesn't really matter since you are in fact riding it and you will never see it 90% of the time. I agree; it is true. 

Keeping your bike fit and finished just shows that you value your investment :).
