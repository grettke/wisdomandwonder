#+TITLE: The Dylan programming language

When reading about Scheme or Smalltalk, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_programming_language][Dylan]] programming language is often mentioned.

[[http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~jsobel/][Here]] is one person who likes it that has provided some notes on how to [[http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~jsobel/forschemers.html][translate Scheme to Dylan]]. Here is his take on it:



#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Dylan is a completely object-oriented language, with multiple inheritance, generic functions, a powerful module system, a very expressive exception-handling system, hygienic macros, pleasant semantics, and a clean way to turn the knob between expensive dynamic behavior and efficient static constraints.
#+END_QUOTE



It sounds /very/ interesting.
