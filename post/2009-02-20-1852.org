#+TITLE: Good books on automata theory?

I asked "What is a good book on automata theory?" because I don't recall much of it from college. Marco replied [[http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2009-February/030735.html][here]]: Elements of the Theory of Computation by Lewis and Papadimitriou.

Do you know of any more?

  The 1979 edition of "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation", by Hopcroft and Ullman. The algorithms are pretty imperative, though.

  I very much appreciate: Formal Languages and their |Relation to Automata by John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman. My first read through it was 40 years ago, but even nowadays I consult it now and then.
