The design is settling in.

- Don't try to use the keyboard to teach the user what is possible on that
  computer using that keyboard. For me this manifested in the form of trying
  to cram a lot of symbols and idea in each key. It was confusing; you have to
  know what you are doing before you get there, more or less. The idea of
  columns and position 1/2/3 are too literal. There isn't enough space to read
  the symbols. It just doesn't work for me.
  - Only use 4 symbols for the top and 1 for the front
  - Whenever letters have a lower and upper case, only including one letter in
    that column. It will be obvious to the user. I will free-up space on the
    keyboard.
  - Provide modifiers for what you will/would expect coming to keyboard
    - Greek
    - APL
    - Function (Fn)
      - Important because colors distinguish intent
      - Volume
      - Page Up and Page down. It is obvious that you would use function for
        this if you've ever used a laptop.
    - Symbol
      - This is the only other thing I've got, Emoticons and maybe
        Mathematical symbols that aren't on the APL keyboard
- Moved Greek letters to front freeing up space for APL keys
  - Didn't add them set, unsure of the APL2 keyset
    - [[http://www.dyalog.com/uploads/images/Business/products/us_rc.jpg][this]] seems to be it at least for Dyalog
  - APL symbols are two per key, need the space
  - Just want this on the keyboard
- Like colors on the keyboard so pulled colors from [[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized][Solarized]]
- Don't use ISO symbols for modifiers, nobody will know them
  - Set it up using general terms, Alt and Gui
  - Type out Emacs modifiers
- Added APL example for E
  - Place 4 in the left middle
  - APL symbols on right top and bottom
  - Maximize space use for readability
- Difference between symbol and APL key not obvious
- Like macros, key choices must be evidence based for good results
