#+TITLE: OpenMP vs MPI: Who needs more help using it?

OK [[http://hpclab.blogspot.com/2010/03/openmp-vs-mpi-who-is-winner.html][this]] is definitely a tougne-in-cheek post, subtly suggesting that OpenMP is a better API then MPI simply by looking at the number of helpdesk tickets, but it is worth a laugh if you don't take it too seriously :). 

(Especially since they are apples vs oranges)
