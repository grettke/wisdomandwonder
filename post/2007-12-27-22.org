A write-up on the Commercial Users of Functional Programming 07 conference is now available [[http://cufp.galois.com/CUFP-2007-Report.pdf][here]].

It is definitely worth a read for folks who wonder about the “real world” problems that are solved using functional programming. There is a nice mix of both languages and problem domains, and the tone is pretty laid back.
