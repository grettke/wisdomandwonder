#+TITLE: Mitochondria May Be the Missing Link in Understanding Stress Response

From [[http://mentalfloss.com/article/72761/mitochondria-may-be-missing-link-understanding-stress-response][Mitochondria May Be the Missing Link in Understanding Stress Response]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 a pioneering study, recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy
 of Sciences, suggests that mitochondria—the tiny energy centers inside our
 cells, which convert food into ATP, the crucial molecule that stores the
 energy humans need to do pretty much everything—may play a more significant
 role in the stress responses of mammals than previously understood, and even
 in understanding psychiatric and neurologic diseases.
