#+TITLE: Thoughts on HTDP

Originally I figured that a lot of my thoughts would show up here, but they haven't. Instead they get posted directly to the [[http://groups.google.com/group/study-htdp][group]]. That said, here are some thoughts from the week:



-  The beginning student language is interesting: no variable binding and function definitions are only one expression long
-  It is great to be able to talk to other folks about it; interested folks especially
-  A disciplined approach to function definitions is fine with me!
