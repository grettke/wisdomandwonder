#+TITLE: A Visual Interpreter for Students Learning Scheme

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Students who know procedural and object-oriented languages frequently have difficulty learning the functional paradigm. The purpose of this work is to facilitate this transition by designing and implementing a set of visual tools that help students understand how Scheme, a functional language, programs work. To achieve our goals we worked on the implementation of a Scheme interpreter and a set of visual tools for different key aspects of functional programming languages. [[http://www.davidpilo.com/pvts/][Pilo Visualization Tools for Scheme (PVTS)]] emphasizes on the functional programming language paradigm and its visual representations. PVTS can be used by teachers as a teaching tool as well as by students as a learning tool.
