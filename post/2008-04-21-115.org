#+TITLE: How to Learn Scheme (was How to Learn Programming)

1. [[http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/][The Scheme Programming Language]] Third Edition by R. Kent Dybvig
2. +[[http://www.htdp.org/][How to Design Programs]] by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi+
3. +[[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-1.html#titlepage][Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman+



*Addendum 6/26/8:*

The difference between learning a programming language and learning how to program is now clear enough to me that I had to revise this post to clarify its intent and correct its content. As such, the title has been changed, and only one book has been recommended.
