#+TITLE: iPhone Barcode Scanners and Boosting Innovation

[[http://www.ismashphone.com/2009/05/red-laser-the-first-accurate-iphone-barcode-scanner-hits-the-app-store.html][Here]] is a good article about a barcode scanner library for the iPhone. One interesting thing is that the imaging library used in the app is available in a [[http://www.occipital.com/ClearCam][SDK]] sold by the company. 

It seems that the application is meant to drive sales of the API.

I suppose this is not a new idea, but I have never done something like this so it was new to me :).

Seem interesting?
