#+TITLE: A culture of problems

It seems like my culture has expended a great amount of effort in teaching the individual how to identify and report on the sad state of affairs which he is in, but has not taken the next logical step by teaching him how to move beyond that state. He is a man who knows how to identify problems , with no chance of solving them. This is a cruel punishment that has created a culture full of problems seemingly without solutions.
