#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) abo-abo's Hydra Makes You A Lightweight-Literate Programmer Hyper Boosting Your Productivity With About Ten Of Minutes Effort For Learning It

abo-abo's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] functionality has changed both my learning /and/ Emacs workflow.
If you give it a chance with my workflow below you will get even more
power-user type stuff out of it.

The Emacs workflow part is easy: it introduces a new logical namespace for
function calls and brings a nice GUI along for the ride.

The learning workflow is that while I am learning a new package (or anything)
I can stick everything that seems important into a Hydra for that mode.
Instead of writing notes or worrying about settings keybindings for things
that I may or may not use I just put it in the Hydra and keep reading along.
The Hydra becomes the notebook. It is like super lightweight literate
programming because it becomes executable documentation.
