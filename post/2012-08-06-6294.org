#+TITLE: Connecting With People

Four trips. In my life I've been lucky enough to have four great trips. Three around the U.S.A. and one around all of Europe. At the time I thought the whole point was to see things. Well, you see things, and maybe you feel good about them, too. What you remember though are the people. The only way to connect with the people is by connecting with them. Eating with them, talking, laughing, and crying. Nothing else seems to work. Email doesn't work. Internet doesn't work. Phone doesn't work. Thinking about them doesn't work. The only way to connect with people is by connecting.
