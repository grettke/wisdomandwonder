#+TITLE: Managing bibliography references with JabRef

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[http://jabref.sourceforge.net/][JabRef ]]is an open source bibliography reference manager. The native file format
used by JabRef is BibTeX, the standard LaTeX bibliography format. JabRef runs
on the Java VM (version 1.5 or newer), and should work equally well on
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

*Addendum: 2019-09-24*

JabRef continues to be an excellent bibliography manager.

Using BibTeX as the master database and JabRef to populate, manage, and export
from it has been really nice. The key has been letting Emacs manage the keys
and sorting.
