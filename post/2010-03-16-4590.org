#+TITLE: Lua potentially implemented in Guile

In this [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-devel/2010-03/msg00039.html][thread]] the OP discusses implementing Lua on top of Guile as an extension language. It seems that it might be eligible for Google's SOC sponsorship. While the OP doesn't mention wanting help, it /is/ interesting, and who knows other folks might like to contribute.
