#+TITLE: Handling 4 Kinds of Return in Org Mode


You might want more than a few ways to "return" when inside of Org; I did.








-   org-return-indent  :: Make it really easy to work in existing list items,
headings, and tables


   -  This is listed first because I often go back to modify entries

   -  <return> because it is used the most


   

-   org-meta-return  :: Make it really easy to add new list items, headings, and
table contents


   -  M-<return> because the binding comes with Org


   

-   electric-indent-just-newline  :: For when I want to break out of the default
Org indentation to start working at the beginning of the line for example when
I'm done working in a list or have just created a new heading


   -  C-M-<return> because it is next step "lower" in the binding


   

-   [[https://github.com/grettke/home/blob/master/.emacs.el#L436][gcr/smart-open-line]]  :: When I want to insert a new line between the current
and next line then position the cursor correctly indented at the start of it.


   -  s-<return> because it is that is the last place in the modifier key chain
