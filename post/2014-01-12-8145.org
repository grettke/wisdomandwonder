#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][Smartparens]] is minor mode for Emacs that deals with parens pairs and tries to be smart about it. It started as a unification effort to combine functionality of several existing packages in a single, compatible and extensible way to deal with parentheses, delimiters, tags and the like.
