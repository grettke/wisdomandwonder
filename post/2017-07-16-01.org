#+TITLE: How Come I Don't Pray Before Every Bite?

Today I prepare a snack: biscuits with strawberry jam and whipped. They were
great however they don't go with chai. Before I ate I didn't say a prayer.
After I ate I wondered "Why don't I say a prayer before every snack, too? They
are all pretty special. Life is special it is amazing and astounding." Well,
thank goodness for the food that helps make it either heaven or hell.
