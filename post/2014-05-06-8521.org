Ever get a song stuck in your head that just won't get out of it? Ever suffer the frustration that comes with it? 

We all have. Just like when our stomaches haven't been given the right thing to help them to digest what we eat, when we fail to give our mind the right kind of attention then it can't do its job digesting music, either.

The solution is simple: grab a copy of the song and the lyrics for it, find the right page, hit play, and start singing along from start to finish with total concentration on the song and its lyrics. 

Your mind will be very happy that you did the right thing for it, and so will you.
