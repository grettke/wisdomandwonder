#+TITLE: Please Help Me Get A Custom YouTube URL

+My YouTube channel has a un-memorable URL =UCqAqX-rsICAoaIUsmVtGL6A=. It is not+
+as cool as my branded URL =WisdomAndWonder=. But it is confusing having two+
+YouTube accounts. It causes all sorts of trouble because WisdomAndWonder is+
+not a brand. Rather I accidentally created it and didn't know that I did it.+
+In order to simplify things I want to move everything from that account into+
+my personal account. However I can't do that until my personal YouTube account+
+has a nice looking URL, like =GrantRettke= maybe. However, YouTube will only+
+give me a pretty URL if I have 100 subscribers. And I don't.+

Probably I don't even know 100 people. However, whoever you are, can you
please help me out and subscribe to [[https://www.youtube.com/+WisdomAndWonder][my channel]]?
