#+TITLE: Oleg Kiselyov and tons of Scheme code

A friend of mine once mentioned "Oleg's prolific Scheme code" but didn't go any deeper than that.

Today I think I found that code [[http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/][here]].

It is not limited to Scheme, but for Scheme content alone there seems to be a ton of (per my friend) high quality code there. 

I can't wait to start digging.
