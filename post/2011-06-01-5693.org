The awesome [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pretty-mode.el][pretty-mode]] for Emacs displays symbols of your choosing rather than text for specified patterns. For example if you have a lot of Greek letter names in your MATLAB code you might just have the symbol show up instead. 

After upgrading to Emacs version 23 on Windows (GNU Emacs 23.3.1 (i386-mingw-nt6.1.7600) of 2011-03-10 on 3249CTO) though the symbols get clipped off. Here is what I mean:

When I place the cursor on the lambda in this case, it renders correctly:

However, when I modify the buffer, the characters again renders incorrectly.

When I type in the Unicode characters directly; they render just fine.

My current approach for figuring out what is going on has been to read the code and the Elisp API. From what I can see, it "looks right". Right now I'm just documenting it here to try to get a pointer on where to look next.
