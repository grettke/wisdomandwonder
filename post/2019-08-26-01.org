No,

It usually is.

My own experience has only been to use it when I don't understand the load
order and want to "just make it work". Very pragmatic and in the long run it
has to change.

According to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Hooks-for-Loading.html][the manual]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use ~with-eval-after-load~.
#+END_QUOTE

Its great to be normal.


*Addendum: 2019-09-09*

Thank you Phil for pointing out the inaccuracy in this post. I'd written the
wrong thing down and it totally changed the meaning of the post. The title had
been "Is Are Load Hooks Always A Bad Idea?" and I changed it to
"Is `with-eval-after-load' Always A Bad Idea?"
