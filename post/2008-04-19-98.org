#+TITLE: R6RS can complete with Common Lisp?

[[http://www.r6rs.org/][R6RS]] is the new language specification for Scheme. The goal is to provide programming features that folks need for programming "in the large". 

Can it compete with Common Lisp? I don't think so. I like to think of R6RS as an experiment.

I might be right; I [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/3a5cc1353190030b][might be wrong]].
