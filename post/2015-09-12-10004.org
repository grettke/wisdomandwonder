#+TITLE: Literate DevOps: My OS X Development System

Setting up a development system is a non-trivial investment.

[[https://github.com/grettke/osx-provision/blob/master/C02M/provisioning.org][This document]] captures the steps required and automates as much as possible. The
[[https://github.com/grettke/osx-provision/tree/master/C02M][project]] has other formats, too.

The Style Guide is a *must read* for the operator.

[[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] converted this manual, tedious, and error prone task to a
semi-automated, nearly reproducible, and error-less process, for /me/. This document
has never been beta tested; I am it's *only* user.
