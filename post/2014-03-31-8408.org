#+TITLE: Love offerings

"Love offerings" are often a derided and despised thing. At best "Why can't they just say that they are materialistic?". At worst "Why can't they just say they are greedy?". 

We live in a socio-economic system that when combined with a reality that is subject to death, decay, and destruction can obviously stress people out. 

A love offering is a two-fold action. In making one, you simultaneously help to create an environment where others may learn to do so, and in doing so you ought to experience that divine love, as will they. 

They really only make sense when they are undertaken from the heart, not the mind.

Anything else would be really unpleasant.
