#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) Run Two Copies of Emacs To Provide Multithreading

A couple weeks ago I was working on an analysis program in Elisp. I would
write the code, run the results out to a file, study the results, make some
changes, and go back to the beginning. Sometimes the code would take ten
seconds to run. My fault, it just isn't written for speed. Still I griped
about Emacs's lack of multitheading because I couldn't do anything for 10
seconds. Then it hit me: Doh! Just start two copies of Emacs, one to run the
code in and another to do everything else in.

Sure, that sounds really bad to say it, but I'll go on: most computers today
run with multiple cores and gigabytes of RAM so it has virtually no impact on
your operating system to run two instances. Everybody knows this, but my gut
says that this is poor OS management and just a bad way to solve problems.
But, my gut still thinks about a world where it was excited to double the RAM
on it's 33MHz computer from 4MB to 8MB.

My gut needs to join modern times considering it runs a copy of macOS inside
of VMWare all the day while I do everything else, including using two Emacs
instances ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜®.
