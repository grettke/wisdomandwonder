#+TITLE: F Sharp for the Holidays

To help drum up excitement for the recently released Visual Studio .NET 2008 (VS08) at the [[http://www.wi-ineta.org/][WI-INETA]] Holiday Party this year, folks who are passionate about .NET are being encouraged to give 5-minute micro-presentations on new features about which they are particularly excited. One rumor that piqued my interest was that F# would be released as part of VS08.

As it turns out, although F# did not get released with VS08, [[http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2007/11/30/full-release-notes-for-f-1-9-3-7.aspx][F# RC 1.9.3.7]] is available in the form of a stand alone installer which provides VS08 integration. Installation is fast and easy, and in no time you will be up and running with a powerful functional programming language, a great IDE, and full access to the latest and greatest APIs that Microsoft has to offer. The following is a screenshot with a few niceties highlighted in blue:

Although technically it may fall outside the bounds of the original WI-INETA goal of presenting only on VS08 features, I'm hoping that [[http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/thepopeofthehub/archive/2006/02/21/FSharpPresentationINETA20060221.aspx][optionsScalper]] will return to reprise his role as the local F# evangelist by giving a micro-presentation on F# and VS08.

Enjoy!
