#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Vicare Scheme is an experimental fork of Ikarus Scheme; "Vicare" is pronounced the etruscan way. While the long term aim of the project is still not clearly established, Vicare has the following short and midterm goals: fix bugs; push compliance with R6RS, keeping a pragmatic eye at issues; enhance the POSIX interface.

The thing is that [[http://ikarus-scheme.org/][Ikarus]]hasn't been maintained and Aziz seems to be busy with other things.
