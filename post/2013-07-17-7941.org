#+TITLE: Angular Unstable will be in Bower Soon

Tried to install AngularJS unstable today via bower and followed this trail:


-  [[https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3098][make version 1.1.5 available on bower packages ( create a 1.1.5 tag )]]
-  [[https://github.com/angular/bower-angular/issues/9][Include unstable versions]]
-  [[https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/266][Bower should install stable components by default]]
-  [[https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/188][Add support for semver 2.0.0-rc.1's build level]]



to find that Bower currently doesn't support unstable releases due to a versioning issue, but, they will soon.

In the meantime, [[https://github.com/michaelahlers][Michael Ahlers]] went above and beyond to provide an alternative [[https://github.com/PatternConsulting/bower-angular][here]].
