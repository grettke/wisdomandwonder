** Preparation

- Pretend you are going to a job-interview, or on a date, that is recorded for
  everyone to see, forever
  - Perform all personal preparations that you normally would for example
    - Brush your teeth
- Applied [[http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/revlon-photoready-prime-%252b-anti-shine-balm/ID=prod6272387-product?ext=gooPLA_-_Beauty&pla&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&adtype=pla_with_promotion&kpid=sku6231294&sst=abb5cf84-d367-4b3f-94fe-8140a77f2d18][Revlon PhotoReady Prime + Anti Shine Balm Clear]]
  - First watched a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VEsLuyTvD8][video how-to]], YouTube rocks

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Save in new folder with name same as post
- Dragged in jingle
- Dragged in banner 1920x1080
- Now it is row 1: WNW 512x512 logo
  - Drag it over to start of recording so it doesn't show up on
   the banner page, stretch it for the whole recording
  - Make it 25% opaque
  - Scale it 50%
  - Place it top right corner
  - Move it10 arrow clicks left and up
- Now it is row 1: banner, video/sound
- Row 2: jingle, screen recording
  - Make it occupy bottom right quadrant, high up though, so the
    lower third will look right. Leave scale at 100% so the size
    will always look right
- Line them up
- Starting ending transition on banner, FLASH and ripple
- On "Screen Recording"
  - Don't show mouse pointer
  - Do show keystrokes
- At start of video, add L3,
- Add a text box 7 second after L3
  - Paste in title of post
  - Georgia font
  - Make font size so it fits in box and looks right
  - No backdrop
  - Resize the box so it is just big enough to hold text
  - Reposition box so that it is centered on the page
  - Resize to disappear at the right time, so make the text
     disappear about a second before L3 disappears
- Start listening
- Corrections made (3-4 hours, good to learn, painful to do, great motivation
  never to say and do these things again)
  - "So"
  - "Um"
  - "And"
  - "You know"
  - Long pauses
  - Stuttering
  - Hesitating
  - Repeating
  - Not looking into camera
  - Sing-songy
  - Why tell the story exactly as I experienced it? The story was
    important to me that doesn't mean it is important to anyone
    else. What is important to anyone else is the information.
  - The purpose of a screencast isn't for me to figure out what is
    important, it is for other people to figure that out.
- File, Export, Project Dir, Web-High, Scale 100%
- Prepare blog post
  - Title is name of post
  - Body is Source and comments here:
  - Add link later
- Watch entire exported video
- Upload to YouTube
- Get link of video and post blog post
- Update video with link to blog post
- Verify social outlets published
- Manually post to Reddit and remember to reply to comments

* Outcome & Feedback

- Script
  - Good because I focused on key points
  - Missed a key point and added it to blog post as addendum
  - First version was totally not what I wanted; 2nd version seemed great,
    really needed the 3rd version
- Audio volume was perfect
- Lighting was great
- Blogged on essence of screencast in an attempt to provide best of both words
  - Title prepended with (Blog and Screencast)
- 10m might be too long
  - Nick suggested adding a table-on-contents
- 7h of work for 10m of content
- Detailed notes make new production simple, easier, and faster
- Feel smarter about Screenflow
- Speaking slowly has the good quality of being more accessible to non-native
  English speaks combined with the ability to speed-up video with YouTube
  - *There is an additional benefit*
    - It is easier to make corrections on slowly spoken video
    - Corrections to quickly spoken audio and video require
      millisecond-spanning corrections which are tedious and difficult and
      boring
      - Further motivation not to make the mistakes in the first place
