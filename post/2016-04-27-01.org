#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 28: Simple Seven

This makes sense. No =Fn= necessary. Emacs only.

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Combining learning with layout results in a lot of changes
- The =Fn= key
  - Great way to save a row
  - Emacs users are already comfortable with chords
  - Was interesting when smaller than tenkeyless; still good to get it down to
    6 rows
- Why are the =F= keys up so high?
  - Is the layout by design or arbitrary?
  - Can we make a rectangle with them flat?
- Can a tenkeyless still be a rectangle?
  - The ANSI 104 layout is OK with resizing keys just to fit the shape
- CAS
  - Easy to in this layout, redundant
  - C-M-s-H would be hard
- The ANSI 104 layout
  - Is probably a good thing
  - I use it and like it
  - Make it a big rectangle
- How to make the case
  - Easy to carry anywhere like a Dell keyboard
  - Easily 3d printable
  - Inexpensive
  - Open design
- Can the system and navigation keys line up in a row on the right?
- This keyboard is for Emacs users
  - That is the singular focus
  - Forget about general acceptance and use
    - It will be generally usable though
- Steps
  - Move Escape row down above numbers and move them all left
  - Move Delete above backspace
    - Logical location
  - Ultra key
    - [[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/87330/which-is-higher-hyper-ultra-or-super][Via]], better than omega
    - Control Meta Super Hyper
    - Move below Meta, shift needs to be outside enter, more familiar
    - Alt and Gui are better positioned, they are closer really
  - Align PrtSc with delete
  - Align cluster by frequency
    - Pg Up, Pg Dn
    - Home, End
    - Insert, PrtSc
  - Space bar can be 6 bars wide
    - Unsure where to find smaller
  - Main board keys on right (delete, super) can be smaller, make them all
    standardish
  - Keep right side keys flush with left
    - No, doesn't look right
  - Modifier board
    - Fill to rectangle
      - Make Emacs modifiers bigger, 1.5w
      - Leave OS modifiers 1.25
  - Made control a homing here
    - There is a lot more space down there
    - Can make sense of lactation given two big bars and edges
    - Removed homing, unnecessary based on using a real heyboard
