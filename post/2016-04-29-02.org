- The right side keys should remain in ANSI layout
  - Complies with [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment][POLA]]
  - Returned them
- Put CapsLock above Backspace
- [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0][SpaceFn]] makes you want to use [[https://github.com/tmk/tmk_core/blob/master/doc/keymap.md][TMK's awesome firmware]]
  - Remind my self that POLA is still an important goal
- How are people carrying their keyboards?
- A good keyboard body negates needs for a case
  - Dell keyboards are a perfect example

- How similar is this to an ANSI layout
  - Background color legend
    - Green: Identical
    - Yellow: Moved
    - Turquoise: New
    - Red: Removed
      - Only the number pad was removed

- Thoughts
  - Every Emacs user who has reconfigured their modifier keys on a Windows or
    Mac laptop will be OK with this
  - Every user who has used an ANSI layout will be OK with this
  - Users who value the number pad will not be OK with this
  - The modifier clusters make sense
