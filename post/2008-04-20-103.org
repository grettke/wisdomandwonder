#+TITLE: Where to start with The Lambda Calculus

When you first start studying functional programming, one of the things that people will ask you is "So; have you learned lambda calculus (TLC)?". 

The fact is that while you don't need to learn TLC to learn about functional programming; you /ought/ too study the TLC at some point.

In [[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/492][this great LtU thread]] on "where to get started with studying programming language theory", Anton van Straaten [[http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/492#comment-36585][posted a comment]] referencing two posts on the PLT discussion list detailing [[http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2007-August/020296.html][a plan]] on what you should study when it comes to TLC and [[http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2007-August/020302.html][the texts]] that you should use to facilitate those studies.
