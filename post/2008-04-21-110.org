#+TITLE: Why you should learn Forth

[[http://hcsw.org/reading/forth.txt][One mans vision]], alternately it could be called "A Teaser for Forth"!

Forth and Lisp sound philosophically quite similar, though in Lisp you can't do things as wild as redefining the number one! 

This is a yet another great read that will make you want to learn Forth.
