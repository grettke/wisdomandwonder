#+TITLE: Teaching Programming Languages in a Post-Linnaean Age

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Programming language ``paradigms'' are a moribund and tedious legacy of a bygone age. Modern language designers pay them no respect, so why do our courses slavishly adhere to them? [[http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/][This paper]] argues that we should abandon this method of teaching languages, offers an alternative, reconciles an important split in programming language education, and describes a textbook that explores these matters.

This is a nice paper explaining the author's rationale for his approach.
