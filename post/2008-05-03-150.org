#+TITLE: Writing a Brainf*** compiler and interpreter

[[http://esoteric.voxelperfect.net/wiki/Brainfuck][Brainf***]] is a Turing complete programming language, known for its esoteric "minimalist nature", that has gained quite a bit of popularity over the years. 

While you most certainly wouldn't want to write much code /in/ this language, it might be fun to write a compiler for this language, and even an interpreter to test our your compiler!
