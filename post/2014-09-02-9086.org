#+TITLE: How to debug within R


In my words this is how to debug within R:





-  If you want to *print a stack trace* for the most recent exception


   -  then use =traceback=

   -  you may or may not have the source


   

-  If you want to *set a breakpoint at a specific location* in the code


   -  then use =browser=

   -  you must have the source

   -  it may be conditional


   

-  If you want to *set a breakpoint on a function* at its
entry point


   -  then use =debug=

   -  you may or may not have the source

   -  delegates work to =browser=


   

-  If you want to *install a global exception handler* that will immediately start
debugging


   -  then use =recover=

   -  you may or may not have the source


   

-  If you want to *add watch statement* to a function


   -  then use =trace=

   -  you may or may not have the source
