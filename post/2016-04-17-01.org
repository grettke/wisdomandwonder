- VI keyboard is redundant if you prioritize Escape placement
- Ortho-linear?
  - How about grid?
- The mouse keys are toys, don't need them
- Volume control is a toy, the OS can do it
  - Helps make it work well cross-platform, too
- I need to color the keys by my classification of how I see them or how
  Emacs sees them
  - EMACS MODIFIERS
    - Ctrl
    - Including Escape?
    - Emacs can use OS modifiers, that is user's call
    - Include every permutation?
  - OS MODIFIERS
    - Ctrol
    - Alt
    - Gui
    - Include every permutation?
    - Symbol 2 and Symbol 3
      - Use the character in the 2nd or 3rd column of the cap
      - Shift can modify it
      - Allows APL keyboard or more
    - Function
      - Laptops have them
      - Let arrow keys be page up for example
      - How is this different than Symbol2 and Symbol2???
    - Meh
      - Seems like a good thing for generic programs
        - Required with More f keys?
          - Yea definitely, still useful for every OS
  - SYMBOLS
    - Latin
    - Greek
    - Unicode
    - F keys
  - COMPUTER
    - Print screen
    - Do I need scroll lock?
    - Do I need pause/break?
  - DESTRUCTORS
    - Backspace and delete
    - Insert
  - Movement
    - Arrow keys move cursor in buffer
    - Return and space insert symbols, but they are more about movement than
      the character, kind of
- Bigger than 8x16?
  - Nice to use more
  - Don't want to clash with other vendor offerings
    - Scope helps define priorities; without it include all of Unicode
- Include Greek and APL?
  - Personal preference
  - Intriguing
  - Can re-image firmware anyway, so it's a question of keycaps and firmware,
    not the keyboard itself
- Labels keys with names instead of actual signal
- Make fonts symbols take up space of entire cap
- Keyboards
  - Insert symbols into buffer
  - Modify the buffer
  - Move point to different locations in the buffer
  - Tell the OS things
  - Change buffer modification mode
  - Is it true that everything keyboards do is to provide characters that
    might be modified?
