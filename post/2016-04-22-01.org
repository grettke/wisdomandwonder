#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 19: Emacs on Every Desk

An emotional flood of pragmatism and market demand is forcing me to struggle to
keep my head above water on this one which answers a simpler question:

Q. How to get Emacs and an Emacs suitable keyboard into the hands of every
computer user everywhere?

A. High quality, low cost, flexible, and familiar.

- Thoughts and changes from 18
  - Switch with staggered querty. It might be painful to switch. Pain ain't a
    great motivator in this scenario. Goal is to learn and use Emacs, not
    suffer inflammation.
    - Personal experience on staggered qwerty has convinced me that pain will come
      to switch to a grid layout. Don't want to try. Don't want others to try.
      Don't want pain to be a reason to avoid an Emacs keyboard.
  - Keyboard needs to be black and white, everything else is too distracting
  - Only used HID Spec for keys
    - Don't write a HID spec to do more, not now
- Build
  - Start with ANSI 104
    - Make it easy to see what keys need to stay, or not
  - Row 6, the F keys don't need any spacing
    - By the time you reach that far, it is hard reach, so linear is fine
  - Add F13-F24
    - They are in the spec, use them!
  - Add F13-F24
  - Handle every key to the right of Enter
    - Keep PrtSc, Insert, Home, delete, end, pgup, pgdn, arrow keys
    - Delete ScrollLock, Pause/Break, NumLock
  - Add a Fn key
    - Put arrows on jkil
  - Placed a cluster for inser/delete, and navigation, print screen
  - Modifiers
    - Make them agnostic, use the real names
    - Only need 1 key width
    - Don't need 6 width for spacebar
    - Modifers go out from common to uncommon so
      - left to right: C, M, s, H, A, G
      - On both sides
      - Emacs modifiers are more important to put then near space bar
      - OS modifiers are still an easy reach
- Thoughts
  - Easily use all Emacs and OS modifiers in familiar positions
  - Rest of layout is undisturbed
  - More F keys
    - Grid like because it is already a reach
  - Fn key is knew, an simple
  - Felt like the spacebar was too small so
    - Moved Alt up by Shift, this resulted in
      - Manual Meh key
  - Remember to keep C-A-D available on Win
