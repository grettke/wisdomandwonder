#+TITLE: The iPodTouch Is What The OLPC XO Should Have Been

The iPodTouch is a mass-marketed device, so its cost has been driven down. An 8Gb device costs only $230. 

Its development environment nearly demands performance. Its development language is Objective-C or C and only one app can be run at a time. Contrast that with Sugar on X11 on Python on C and an environment that exhausts available memory with very little effort. 

Its touch screen encourages interaction. The XOs flakey keyboard and touchpad discourage it.

I still love the XO and OLPC's mission. The only thing that they seem to have accomplished, though, is the proliferation of Netbooks across the commercial landscape.
