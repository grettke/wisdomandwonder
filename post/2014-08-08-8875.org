#+TITLE: All creativity is an extended form of a joke

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
All creativity is an extended form of a joke. Most creativity is a transition
from one context into another where things are more surprising. There's an
element of surprise, and especially in science, there is often laughter that
goes along with the "Aha." Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us
that there are more contexts than the one that we're in--the one that we think
is reality.
