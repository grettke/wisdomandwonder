#+TITLE: Java One 08 Keynote

Is Sun in touch with Java developers?

The entire keynote was spent talking about how developers are soon going to be able to write applets that run on a desktop, in a web browser, and also on a phone. We have had this for years. Whose idea was this?

The really interesting stuff in Java land right now is Java 7 features and concurrent programming with Java, but apparently none of that was worth mentioning.

The worst part of it all is that during the demo, the applet repeatedly crashed, and crashed, and crashed. The first Java program that I ever saw was running was an applet running in a web browser, in 1995.

13 years to get applets right? Come on Sun.
