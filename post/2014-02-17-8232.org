#+TITLE: Loctite Your One-Quarter Inch Audio Cables

Some of our audio cables were lost in the move. Bought some nice replacements and just like the old ones the end capes were loose and nearly falling off. Didn't really like it the last time and unsure why I didn't permanently fix it last time, but blue Loctite should be just fine.
