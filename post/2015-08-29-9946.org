#+TITLE: Migrating to Org2Blog

[[https://wordpress.com/][WordPress]] is a powerful and satisfying writing and publishing platform. After
learning Org-Mode, I wanted to use Org-Mode for writing and WordPress for
publishing. [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][Org2Blog]] makes that easy.

WordPress easily exports your posts to XML. [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog-importers][Org2Blog-Importers]] converts them
to Org-Mode via [[http://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]]. Tonight I converted them [[https://github.com/grettke/wisdomandwonder/tree/master/post][here]]. Any future modifications
belong in these documents with publishing to WordPress.

I tested both publishing new posts and modifying and re-publishing old posts and
both worked correctly.
