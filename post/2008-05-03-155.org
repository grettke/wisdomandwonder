#+TITLE: Scheme is mysophobic

[[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/07b915645de0cec7][Here]] is an interesting post about hygiene and its sociological impact on the two Lisp groups of Schemers and Common Lispers. 

While the post itself is a troll, the author:


1. Uses a very accessible analogy.
2. Quite clearly communicates a number of differences between Scheme and Common Lisp when it comes not only to hygiene but also language design.



The interesting thing about this post is that the only difference between this post being a troll and an educational article is how the content was delivered. If you remove the cruddy name-calling, whining, and complaining; it would have been a really good post on the difference between the languages. That is wild!
