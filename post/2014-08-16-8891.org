[[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470973927.html][The R Book, 2nd Edition]] is a nice read and resource just four chapters in. It is new to me to find a resource that poses so many examples of things you want to accomplish with links for explanations how, instead of presenting a core of functionality and letting you choose how yourself. Definitely a "read-as-you-need" book, and the first chapter even explains how best to utilize it in that manner.

*Addendum: 2014-08-23T11:15:48-0500*

Chapters 1-5 seem to be about R proper, and everything else is about applied statistics.
