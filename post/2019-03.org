The only time that I call ~beginning-of-buffer~ is when I want to visit the file
header, which isn't very often. The rest of the time I only want to go up to
where the code begins, or at least close to it. That is the logical beginning
of the buffer. Another example is going to the beginning of a ~magit-status~
invoked buffer: I've never use the first first 3 lines of it. The logical
start of it is the Untracked file listing. The Beginend package moves your
cursor to the the logical beginning of the buffer content. It also implements a
logical ~end-of-buffer~. It might not sound like much, but it bumps up your user
experience by more than a few notches: it makes the modes do what many of us
are thinking and that is the ultimate feel good experience. Here is an
example:

When I'm good about using and re-using functions in Bash I /always/ end up
passing arguments through from one function to another. For example:

#+name: Function Passings Arguments To Another Function
#+begin_src shell
function pie {
  open /Applications/Emacs.app --args --debug-init "$@"
}

function pienthm {
  EMACSNOTHEME=t pie --reverse-video "$@"
}
#+end_src

Horrible to admit but I keep forgetting the syntax even are taking copious
notes on the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/][GNU Bash manual]].

BTW: hear, hear to including Bash-isms in every shell script!
