[[http://www.azquotes.com/quote/856290][So, you've got a problem? That's good!]] Why? Because repeated victories over
your problems are the rungs on your ladder of success. With each victory, you
grow in wisdom, stature and experience. You become a better, bigger, more
successful person each time you meet a problem and tackle and conquer it with
a positive mental attitude.

-- W. Clement Stone
