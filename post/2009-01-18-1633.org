In [[http://list.cs.brown.edu/pipermail/plt-scheme/2009-January/029782.html][this thread]] about a closure puzzler Jens posted Eugene Kohlbecker's mind-bender called Mondo Bizarro.



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
;;; Mondo Bizarro

; What does the following program print?
; Why?

(define program (lambda ()
    (let ((y (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
         (display 1)
         (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) (y c)))
         (display 2)
         (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) (y c)))
         (display 3))))


(program)

Mondo Bizarro seems to have been originally published in ACM SIGPLAN Lisp Pointers, Volume 1, Issue 2 (June-July 1987), located [[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1317193.1317197][here]]; but I could not confirm that.

[[http://arcfn.com/2008/03/continuations-made-difficult.html][Here]] is an implementation of it in Java.
