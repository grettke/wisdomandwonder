#+TITLE: Sugar - Release 8.2.0

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_(GUI)][Sugar]] is the UI portion of the Linux build that runs on the OLPC XO.

It is a radical departure from what we would call "typical" user interfaces in 2008; and it really took some "getting used to it". With the [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Release_notes/8.2.0][release of 8.20]], it looks like they have made some "user friendly" Sugar and a few other things, too:



-  A nice looking [[http://www.laptop.org/8.2.0/manual/][User Manual]]
-  Better [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Feature_Longer_battery_life][Power Management]]
-  Significant [[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Feature_GUI_and_usability_improvements][changes to the UI]] "to improve the user experience".



It took guts to come up with Sugar, and perhaps even more to make these kinds of changes. As minimal as they seem, they are not insignificant. 

Disclaimer: I have not yet tried out this build as my XO is currently out on loan.
