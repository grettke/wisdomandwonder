#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I use Exchange at work for calendaring. I also use terminal-mode emacsclient when I'm logged in from another machine. In that scenario I can't easily open a web browser to use Outlook Web Access. It annoyed me that I couldn't check my schedule from within a terminal Emacs session. Thus, I did the only sensible thing and implemented full Exchange Web Services API support for Emacs.
