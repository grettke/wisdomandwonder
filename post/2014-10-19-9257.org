#+TITLE: When is a number an integer?

[[http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/how-to-judge-a-virable-is-a-integer-td4698489.html][This]] post poses a seemingly very simple question:

"When is a number an integer?"

and very quickly evolves to provide a delightful exposition of what it means when someone answers with "it depends".

My vote is that the most intuitive and least-surprising approach is =x%%1==0=.
