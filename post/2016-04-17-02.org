#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design Strategy

Keyboard design is a delicate balance between the subtlety of poetry and the
simplicity of a sledgehammer.

Here is how I scoped down millions of permutations into something more
manageable that may result in an actual keyboard within the next year.

* Step 01: Talk Yourself out of Doing It

- You already know how to use a keyboard?
  - If yes: There are already excellent keyboards and layouts ready for you
    to use
    - You can use them faster than creating it up yourself
- Do you need a new keyboard?
  - If yes: There are already excellent keyboard manufacturers
    - To name a *few*: [[https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/][Kinesis]], [[http://www.maltron.com/][Maltron]], [[https://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&pid=pdkb400b][Happy Hacking]], [[https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/keyboards][Microsoft]], [[http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/][WASD]], [[http://cherryamericas.com/product-category/desktop/][Cherry]],
      [[https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ergodox-ez-an-incredible-mechanical-keyboard#/][ErgoDox]], [[https://www.massdrop.com/buy/planck-mechanical-keyboard][Planck]]
    - You can buy one faster then making one yourself
- Do you need a new key layout?
  - If yes: There are already excellent key layouts
    - To name [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout/chart][a few]]: Dvorak, Colemak, Workman
    - You can use one faster than making a new one yourself
- If you answered no to any of these questions
  - Go back and read all literature and research everything out there
    additionally everything also not in the list
- If after reading everything, familiarizing yourself with all offerings,
  thought through the entirety of everything
  - You still want to design your own keyboard
    - Then be sure you've studied everything available
    - Move on to the next heading

* Step 02: Define Some Simple Measure of Success

- How will you know when you've successfully designed your perfect keyboard?
  - When I've defined my measure for success and reached it
- Who is your audience?
  - Me
  - My family
  - My friends
  - Other Emacs users
  - Other LaTeX users
  - Other programmers: Lisp, APL
- What programs will you use it with?
  - Everything typical of the OS
  - Emacs so provide all meta keys
- What operating systems will you use it on?
  - OS X
  - Windows
  - Linux
- Have you tried and failed every possible way and are convinced that you need
  a custom keyboard?
  - I've spent hundreds of hours over the years tweaking my configuration for
    the different keyboards I've used. The Dell ISO and the MacBook Pro are
    the best. No matter what I try, I can't make them he same, and I can't
    move around the keys.

* Step 03: Keyboard Modeling

- If you can't get what you want out of the keyboards above then you want
  something unique and uncommon. That is fine, I do to. For me the easiest way
  is to buy a large matrix reprogrammable keyboard.
- I chose the [[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10141/prototype-your-keyboard-layout-first-x-keys-xke-128][XKE-128]].
- Model, develop, prototype, revise, retry, restart
- This keyboard gives you a place to make the mistakes instead of wasting your
  precious time and money during your own personal learning process
