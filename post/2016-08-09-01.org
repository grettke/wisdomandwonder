#+TITLE: Delightful @Microsoft #Windows10 Upgrade Experience

Figured it wouldn't make sense to pass up a $200USD free upgrade from Windows
7 Professional to Windows 10 Pro so I clicked "Yes" and the download began.

Fourteen hours later the installation completed and I was left with a Windows
box that booted *faster* than before!

The new Windows release is faster and it includes Bash. /Yes/ times have changed.
