#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[https://github.com/browse-kill-ring/browse-kill-ring][Ever]] wish you could just look through everything you've killed recently to find out if you killed that piece of text that you think you killed, but you're not quite sure?
#+END_QUOTE



I haven't, but kind of wish I did, because this package looks interesting. 

Wondering if my workflow obviates the need for it, or, I'm just "doing it wrong".
