#+TITLE: Serious Statistics Programs Pay for the Fun Ones

[[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9138264/Billionaire_SAS_co_founder_keeps_on_coding][Here]] is an article that explains how one of the four co-founders of SAS, a statistician, has an awesome job where the serious product (SAS) pays for him to develop the fun product (JMP). 

Note: That is an understatement, as it probably would pay for him to stare at the ocean for the rest of his life if he wanted. It is still a good point, though: sell serious stuff to pay for the fun (for you) stuff.
