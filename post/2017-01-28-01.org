#+TITLE: The Perfect "Little" Calculator

The [[http://amzn.to/2jhdl9R][Texas Instruments TI-30X IIS 2-Line Scientific Calculator]] is perfect
because

- It is /scientific/ so it does just about everything you would ever want in
  addition to the basics so it includes
  - A 2-line display
  - Statistics on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmViWI3x6LI][one and two variables]]
  - Degrees, radians and grads
  - Scientific and engineering notation
  - Fractions
  - Conversion
  - Copy and paste with multiple storage cells
- It is little
- It has a sliding protective computer
- It works both off battery and solar energy
- It less than a new air filter

You can buy a science and math friendly calculator that costs next to nothing,
can take anywhere without worrying about powering /or/ dropping it, to easily
work on just about any /real word/ calculation that you find yourself doing
every day.

This calculator rocks!
