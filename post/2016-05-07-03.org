#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 34: Grid Layout Revisited

The latest iteration places space and return well and the modifiers are all
present and easily reached. How would it look in a grid layout?

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Start with design [[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10220/emacs-keyboard-design-33-what-if-emacs-pinky-isnt-real][33]]
- Left-align the rows on 1, Q, A, Z
- Keep F-space and J-space aligned
- Make shift 1x
- Add a gap after G to put halves as far apart as possible
  - Only 2 rows available, not enough for a gap, put it back
- Move PgUp and PgDn above right arrow
  - Use them together frequently
- Insert and Delete are stacked right of Back Space
  - Logically close
- Home and End right of Fn
- Between Shift and PgUp and Below Fn there are 3 places open so move in there
  - PrSc
  - Scroll Lock
  - Pause Break
  - Last 2 are debatable
  - Want to fill space and layers would be ugly here
- Added separator after 5
  - Original thought was to make them separable
  - Also have no obvious need for that column
  - Left I and II on each side to encourage using both hands
- Added re-legendable keys as "Ghosted"
  - Screenflow is the first candidate
  - Everything else is easy to do in Emacs
- PauseBreak and ScrollLock might not need to be there
- A Mouse layer might be nice, but then again, no
