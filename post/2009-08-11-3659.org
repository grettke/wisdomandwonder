#+TITLE: A List of Wisconsin iPhone Developer Blogs

Are you blogging about iPhone development in Wisconsin? If you are, I would love to add your blog to my list of Wisconsin iPhone developer blogs. Currently there is only one on my list. I know there are folks out there, though, as evidenced by [[http://groups.google.com/group/madison-cocoa-developers][Madison Cocoa Developers]] and [[http://groups.google.com/group/mwiphonesdk][Midwest iPhone SDK Developers]].
