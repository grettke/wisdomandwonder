#+TITLE: Get a green light at every stop

Last year I bought a [[http://www.greenlightstuff.com/trigger.html][greenlight trigger]] from Green Light Products. Installation was easy; I left it clamped overnight. Does it work? Yes, definitely. The only problem is at history has shown me, I don't seen to actually use many intersections that utilize this approach for changing lights :).
