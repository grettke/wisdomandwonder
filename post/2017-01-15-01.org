#+TITLE: A Yoga International Membership is Awesome

[[https://yogainternational.com/][It is worth sharing]].

The normal membership is free and it gives you limited access to tons of
stuff. Great way to figure out whether you want to see more or not.

There is something for everyone from teachers to parents to you name it.

For example the classes on brain health and yoga for TBI recovery are awesome
and you might want to watch them more than once :).
