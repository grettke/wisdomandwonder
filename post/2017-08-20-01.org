#+TITLE: Never Too Late To Learn `multi-occur-in-matching-buffers'

Ever wanted to search all of your buffers limited by their backing file type?
Surprisingly I never did very much. ~ag~ and ~grep~ worked fine for me. Then I
started leaving buffers open, with everything that I cared about, all the
time. Then I joined the "Emacs 100+ Buffer Club".

[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html#index-multi_002doccur_002din_002dmatching_002dbuffers-873][multi-occur-in-matching-buffers]] is helpful when you watch to use ~occur~
in some of those buffers.
