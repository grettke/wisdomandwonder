Might seem crazy to buy a sampler but it lets you do two cool things
- Try out *13* different switches
- You can spend a little more to buy it as an [[http://www.maxkeyboard.com/max-falcon-8-programmable-mini-macropad-mechanical-keyboard-diy-kit.html][8-key programmable keyboard]].

Lessons learned after "typing" on it (trying it out) for 3 days
- The switches are noticeably different
- It takes a few days to feel the difference
- Coming from a MacBook Pro, the linear switches feel great
  - Supposedly only for gamers, would be fine for Mac users
- Should use different switches for different parts of the keyboard
  - Main keys: weak springs because used so frequently
  - Control keys: strong springs because you want to know it happened
  - Modifier keys: strong springs because you will rest your strong fingers there
- Might make you feel better about laying down the cash for a bunch of
  switches before you have "first hand" experience with them
