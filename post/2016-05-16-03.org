#+TITLE: Emacs Keyboard Design 37: Possible

- Small changes to a 104 key ANSI skyrocket the price
- Stay close to the standard to make it affordable

#+HTML: <!--more-->

- Start with the ANSI 104 preset
- Delete the numpad to make it a tenkeyless
- Make the spacebar 6w, they do exist
- Make Ctrl, Win, Menu 1w
  - Make them Emacs keys, with the front text the real key code
- Difficult to press shift-C-M-s-H, so add Ultra
  - C-M-s-H is easily done
- Place Alt and Gui below Delete and End
- Meh key below PgDn
  - No better name, this is the standard
  - Control-Alt-Shift
- Fn below Alt for F13-F24
  - For anything more, makes sense
  - Faster than toggling to a layer
  - Add mouse keys here maybe
- Layer below Meh
  - Easily toggle to any particular layer
  - Don't need individual keys for them
- Thoughts
  - Can buy keycap set from any MX compatible provider (nearly all of them)
    - Costs less
  - Pay for a 104 key keycap set and repurpose the numpad keys as Emacs keys
    - Costs less
  - Sticks with 6 rows
    - Keys at correct height
  - OS and Emacs keys can happily and easily coexist
  - Fn and Layer handle just about everything
