#+TITLE: Bren√© Brown on Joy: It's Terrifying

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKV0BWSPfOw][YouTube]]
- Joy requires gratitude
- Joy is the most terrifying thing that humans experience
- "When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes forboding"
  - "We try to beat vulnerability to the punch"
- "I know because I'm fixing to meet Oprah, I'm going to die" lolol
- "We're trying to dress rehearse tragedy so we can beat vulnerability to the
  punch"
- When happy people feel that, they practice gratitude to defeat that fear
- "In a culture of scarcity, we are always searching for extraordinary when
  the truth is" (that we truly love the ordinary sweet things about our life)
