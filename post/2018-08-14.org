#+TITLE: (Python3+Hardware+Network) Map And Track Wi-Fi Networks You're Not Connected To

Ever wonder how wifi devices talk to each other when they don't know that you
are listening?

#+HTML: <!--more-->

The hardware components of most critical systems, for example Cell Phones and
Wi-Fi access points, operate on an implicit model of trust. In other words if
other "members" of the system /think that you are like them/ then they will help
you do your job. This is a feature that makes our critical system likes Cell
Phones and Wi-Fi access points /so easy/ to use! It also makes them very easy to
explore.

If you are curious about how Wi-Fi networks /really work/ then Caleb's tool
[[https://github.com/calebmadrigal/trackerjacker][trackerjacker]] is a great way to see how connected Wi-Fi devices talk to each
other and more. You don't even need a Wi-Fi access point password just /to look/.

That is one of the lessons learnedâ€”at the end of the day people can learn a
lot about you without you ever knowing about it.

Why they are so curious about you? Good question!

[[https://github.com/calebmadrigal][Caleb]] is a genius. Learn from him.
