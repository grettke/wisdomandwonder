- "Design is a function of connection
- "There is nothing more vulnerable than creativity"
- "What is art if not love"
  - Both contain the attribute of expansiveness
- "The perspiration that noone talks about very often"
  - "The stuff from fear"
- "... the things that inspired me to stay small"

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again
and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who
does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

  - Your body may react to this
- "Do you want to show and be seen?"
  - "Accept that you will get your ass kicked"
    - "Especially if you committed to creating"
    - "If courage is a value that we hold, this is an unavoidable consequence"
- "If you're not in the arena, also getting you ass kicked, then I'm not
  interested in your feedback"
- Vulnerability is the birthplace of all good things in this life
  - Creativity and innovation for example
- "Walk into the arena naked"
- "The three seats that will always be filled in the arena are: shame,
  scarcity, and comparison"
- "The fourth seat is your choice"
- "Reserve seats for them"
  - "I see you. I hear you. I'm gonna show up and do this anyway. You are
    welcome. I'm not interested in your feedback."
- "You need a clarity of values"
- "You gotta have at least one person in your life who is willing to look at
  you when you fail and say "Man, that sucked, it was as bad as you thought,
  but you were brave, let's get you cleaned up because we're gonna get you
  back in"
- "This is someone who loves you not despite your imperfections and
  vulnerabilities, but because of them. They should have great seats."
- "I didn't want to join a club they would let me in"
- "I don't want you guys there..." (you like me already)
- "The people who have the most courage are the most clear about who the
  critics are"
- Hardest thing: "One of these seats needs to be reserved for you"
  - You are your own biggest critic
- "We orphan the parts of us that don't fit the ideal... leaving only the
  critic"
- "The person who believes in what we are doing and why we are doing it"
  should be in that chair
