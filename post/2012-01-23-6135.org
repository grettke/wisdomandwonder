Today I was sort of shocked to learn that there is another implementation besides [[http://sisc-scheme.org/][SISC]] and [[http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/][Kawa]] that runs on Java!

There wasn't even an announcement for NexJ on comp.lang.scheme and NexJ has been around for two years :(! Rather it was mentioned on scheme-reports this week.
