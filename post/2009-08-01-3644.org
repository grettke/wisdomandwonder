#+TITLE: R6RS Chez Scheme 7.4D and TSPL4 Now Available

A R6RS conformant [[http://scheme.com/csv7.4d/7.4d.html][Chez Scheme 7.4D]] and [[http://scheme.com/tspl4/][TSPL4]] now available.

Surprised?! I was. I hadn't heard anything either. Anywhere. From anyone.

Yesterday though, I saw Aaron (dedicated Chez user) posting about R6RS ports [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/msg/8e6edd12a26c82de][here]] and Eduardo mentioned TSPL4's availability here [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/msg/28433d7c57f83da1][here]].

*Addendum: 08/04/09*

The TSPL4 link is broken, but was not at the time of posting. Since the hardcopy hasn't been released yet, I suspect that the link will be down until the hard copy is released.

*Addendum: 08/08/09*

The link is back up. 

FWIW: I didn't think it was worth bothering Kent by asking about why it was down in the first place.
