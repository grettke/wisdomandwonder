This past December, on the fifteenth, I completed the [[http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~dbrowe/mscs6010.html][Probability]] class that I was attending.

We covered Probability from the theoretical (Calculus) and analytical (MATLAB) side of things. In my first foray into theory behind Statistics, I found the relationships between the distributions to be really neat to see, and along with the Calculus, a /lot/ to chew on all at once ;).

Overall it was a lot of fun; I can't wait to get started with Simulation on the eighteenth.
