Q. [[http://groups.google.com/group/study-htdp/browse_thread/thread/524bcb69aff47dbb][Are we doing this to learn Scheme?]]

A. No. As a result of working through the book, we /will/ learn Scheme, but the goal is to learn how write programs, not learn Scheme the programming language. For that you should read [[http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/]].
