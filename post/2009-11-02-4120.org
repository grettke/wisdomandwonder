#+TITLE: What is so bad about being an actuary?

Over the past couple of months I've done some very informal research on what it means to be an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary][actuary]]. From reading the Wikipedia article and also the [[http://www.beanactuary.org/][Be An Actuary]] website it seems like a pretty interesting job. Here is where it gets surprising, though: nearly everyone I know in the insurance industry has communicated that it is a very lonely and boring job. This leaves my question to you: what is so bad about being an actuary?

Here are two other links I've yet to research: [[http://www.soa.org/][Society of Actuaries]]and [[http://www.casact.org/][Casuality Actuarial Society]] (thanks Dr. Rowe), and clearly I need to do more.
