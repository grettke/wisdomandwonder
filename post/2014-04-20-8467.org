Every action that you take sets a standard from which you may pull from to justify how to move forward in life. Take every opportunity that you have to move, and to act, in a virtuous, kind, and cheerful manner. At the very least, do it when it is easy. At the very worst of times, it will serve you both as an example, and as an excuse, to behave in the same manner. In our North American culture today, some people may become quite insulted when you don't react to their misery with meanness, cruelty, and gloom with matching feelings. Know though, that you are doing the right thing in staying virtuous, kind, and cheerful.
