#+TITLE: Inviting Non Programmers To Emacs: (A) Super Text Editor

When my friends look at my computer screen I want to invite them to use Emacs.
But the name "Emacs", like Honda or Maserati tells them nothing. Honda and
Maserati have advertising everywhere though! So I set a frame title that tells
them /something/ about this program! Well, they probably have to like text
editors already. And if they do, then they might be interested in a /Super/ text
editor.

BTW: I am totally serious about this. I want to invite my friends to use this.
Programmers or not, Emacs is still /Free Software/ and that matters for everyone.
And I find Emacs to be super. It is super. You and I know that it's power
comes from Lisp and buffers but "Super Text Editor" also works for me.
