Where is the better place to start APL or J?

Raw notes follow.

- Comments (some summarized) from the references
  - J's biggest feature over APL is =tacit form= which addressed Iverson's
    biggest issues with APL
  - APL's distinctive syntax
  - J is now GPL3
  - J is fuly fledged Function and Object-Oriented
  - J's great documentation, forum and community
  - "J, added a plethora (called adverbs and conjunctions), but removed
    brackets (both axis and indexing), the each operator (in favor of the more
    general rank operator), and last-axis (cumulative) reduction."
  - "If the [J] had been designed in a way that made it easy to use it
    probably would have been one of the most wildly successful languages in
    history."
  - "A line of J could replace a page of just about anything else. In any other
    language, your brain ainâ€™t working half the time; instantiating things,
    making iterators go, building brain dead switch statements, dealing with
    preposterous function call overhead or declarations, writing dumb helper
    patterns that are a tiny variation on something you have done 100 times
    before."
  - J should be considered a language completely unrelated to APL
