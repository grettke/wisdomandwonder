#+TITLE: What is “real code”?

One common complaint about non-mainstream programming languages is that there hasn't been any "real code" written in that particular language. One response to this is the [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/][Practical Common Lisp]] book. 

Whether or not a MP3 database or a spam filter is “real code” is up for debate. Nonetheless, based on the success of the book, people clearly want to see "real code". 

In your mind, what is "real code"? What is it that you need to see in order to believe that a language can do "real work"?
