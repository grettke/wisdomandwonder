[[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html][This]] presentation is brilliant and inspiring. Maybe the ideas aren't new; but the way that Hamming put it all together really "spoke" to me. 

It might seem like a long read; but isn't personal success worth your time?

For now I am not going to highlight the key points; that is an exercise much better left to the reader.
