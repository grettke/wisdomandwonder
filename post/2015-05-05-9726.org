#+TITLE: For Sale: Symbolics MacIvory

Are you the only kid who learned about artificial intelligence in the 80s from the film [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/][WarGames]]? Probably not. Would you like to play a game, though? You still can. Pick up a piece of history [[http://www.ebay.com/itm/Symbolics-MacIvory-model-3-co-processor-in-Apple-Mac-Quadra-700-with-Genera-8-3-/111662317576][here]]. Very very cool. Consciousness expanding when you realize that this dev tech was around in the 80s, long before it would appear in the mainstream.
