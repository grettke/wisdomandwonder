#+TITLE: Screenflow 6 User Guide Highlights

- Recording Monitor makes monitoring easier
  - Easily add markers
- Difference between clips and backing medias turns ScreenFlow (SF) into a
  Lisp-like and Git-like environment for easily trying things out and
  reverting them if you don't like the results
  - Test this out by speeding up or slowing down a clip, *cool*
- Where can I find standard, known-good approaches for visual and audio
  effects in multimedia content production?
- Nested clips
- Templates seem like a really great idea, too
- You can do free-hand callouts that blur and darken areas
- *Everyone must know about snapback actions*
  - Restore the state of the clip to the $N-1$ action
