#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) Try Naming Your Emacs Configuration And Instance

For the fun of it try naming your Emacs configuration and instance.

For example my configuration is named HELP, [[https://github.com/grettke/help][HELP Enables Literate Programming]].
This is the collection of everything I find helpful for Literate Org Mode.
Its also the collection of every single bit of code that people shared to help
me out. It helps a lot. But that is not what I called my editor.

I call my editor instance PIE, PIE Interactive Editor. It is fun calling it a
name that I like instead of Emacs. Emacs mean so many things to all of us.
Even Spacemacs names it especially for them. What is PIE? The PIE Interactive
Editor? But what is PIE? PIE Isn't Emacs ðŸ˜„(Joy)ðŸ˜®(Surprise).

Have fun with it.
