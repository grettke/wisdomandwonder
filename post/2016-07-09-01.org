#+TITLE: All About You

You were sent to this Earth perfect.

Every conceivable thing about you is perfect.

Nothing that you or anyone else ever says or thinks or does can change that.

You can make mistakes. You can do things that ought not be done.

You are still perfect.

You are here for a reason, and you deserve to discover that reason.
