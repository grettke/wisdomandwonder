#+TITLE: Gerbings Heated Coat Liner and Gloves

Last year I bought a Gerbings heated coat liner and T5 gloves. They work great. I'm afraid to turn them past 50% because they get so hot and do it so quickly. This is a good thing, that is their job.

The only mistake I made was to keep the slightly-too-small liner. If you order one, take advantage of their generous exchange policy until you get the right fit.
