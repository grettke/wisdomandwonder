#+TITLE: Wifi-radar hoses my wifi router

If you don't run Sugar on your XO, you need to configure your wireless connection /somehow/, and a lot of folks use wifi-radar, myself included.

While experimenting with it tonight, I noticed that the wireless connection on my other computer quit working periodically. Eventually I did put two and two together and found that everything worked fine when I /wasn't/ running wifi-radar!

Resolving this is of low-priority.
