It's recorded vertically at 4K to play on your computer or smartphone.

It's one minute long, so you need to loop it. If you are playing it on a computer, then you can right-click the video and choose "Loop". If you are playing it on a smartphone, then you need to create a new playlist, add this video, and then put the playlist on repeat.
