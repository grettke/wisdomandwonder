During my vacation, I skimmed Paul Graham's book On Lisp. There were many interesting bits in there:



-  He really tries to "sell the wonder of Lisp". I'm not sure is possible, though.
-  "Users prefer double edged swords to blunt ones"
-  I think that he loves Scheme, but uses CL for practical reasons.
-  He digs deep into code, heavily visiting macros and even implementing continuations, non-determinism, and an object system
-  He is probably a world-class hacker who will never be recognized for his talent, but instead his success
-  This is probably not a good "first Common Lisp book" as it is very deep stuff
