#+TITLE: The Lake

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan][Lake Michigan]] is beautiful without limit. There are a million places along the lakefront from which you can enjoy its beauty. Even from the same locus, it will never, ever look the same twice. For that reason, its beauty can never be captured by image, though perhaps someone more well-spoken could capture how it makes them feel, with words.

You can enjoy it by driving down to the beach and parking, by walking through the streets, or even via a nice bike-path that runs through the city. 

It is our state's greatest natural resource.
