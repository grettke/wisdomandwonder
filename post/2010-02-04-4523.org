#+TITLE: ParEdit for Editing Lispy Languages

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit][ParEdit]] (paredit.el) is a minor mode for performing structured editing of S-expression data. The typical example of this would be Lisp or Scheme source code.

ParEdit helps keep parentheses balanced and adds many keys for moving S-expressions and moving around in S-expressions.

That quote from EmacsWiki /really undersells/ Paredit, though. 

Paredit makes it virtually *impossible to un-balance parentheses* (aka round, square, and curly brackets). 

This mode would be especially interesting for folks avoiding Lisp because of the /nightmare of balancing parentheses/ is too much of an obstacle to overcome (in practice of course it really isn't, even if you don't use Paredit).
