#+TITLE: magrittr: magrittr - a forward-pipe operator for R

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/index.html][Provides]] a mechanism for chaining commands with a new forward-pipe operator. Ceci n'est pas un pipe.

This is a post from /the most understated package definition/ of the year department. =magrittr= is, much like every Scheme library ever, deceptively simple in its power and ease of use that it provides. 

The README, API documentation, and vignette are really, really great, too. Be sure to grok the order-of-evaluation when you've got normal functions on the right-hand-side.
