#+TITLE: Action guides your reaction

When you don't like how you react to things in life, you can address it by focusing 100% upon how you act yourself. Reaction is really re-acting your previous actions.

Your actions will determine how you react.

Does not apply to life-threatening situations, mostly, though.
