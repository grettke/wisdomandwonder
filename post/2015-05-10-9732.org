"[[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CowboyCoder][Cowboy Coders]] are programmers who write code according to their own rules". "Cowboy" is meant to be a derogatory term in this usage. "Cowboy" is a powerful and positive word though, and its connotation is difficult to shake. Perhaps a more appropriate term is "[[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/renegade][Renegade]] Coder".
