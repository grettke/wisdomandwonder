#+TITLE: What I post about Study-HTDP

About three weeks ago I "made it official" and announced the [[http://groups.google.com/group/study-htdp][Study-HTDP]] for any folks who may be interested. I figured that I would post both to the group itself, and mirror the interesting things here. It didn't really work out that way.

Focusing on the work and not much else, I've posted exclusively to the group. Since we're only two weeks into it, though, I'm going to make a change and post the most interesting content here. The reason is that I want to be sure to have a place to keep my notes and thoughts on things so that they don't get totally lost in the overall group.
