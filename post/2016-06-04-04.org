#+TITLE: Bren√© Brown: The Power of Vulnerability

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXSjc-pbXk4][URL]]
- "An ordinary life as become synonymous with a meaningless life"
- You can't hear what she has to share too many times and in too many ways and
  this presentation is another great one
- "Love and belonging are irreducible needs of [humans]"
- Research shows that: "Our capacity for whole-heartedness can never be
  greater than our willingness to be broken-hearted which is terrible but
  truthful"
- "Vulnerability is the path to [everything good about being human]"
- "Empathy fuels connection; sympathy drives disconnection"
- "I know what is like down here and you're not alone" (Empathy)
- "You wanna sandwich?" (Sympathy)
- "Sympathy is how we respond when we don't want to be vulnerable"
- "Blame gives some semblence of control even if it blaming ourselves"
- "Blame is discharging pain"
- "Accountability is a vulnerable process"
- "Empathy is not scripted; it is about being present and engadged"
- "Rarely can a response make something better. What makes something better is
  connection"
- "Shame is I am bad; guilt is I did something bad and the outcomes are hugely
  different"
- "Shame corrodes the part of us that believes that we can change"
