[[https://github.com/hadley/plyr][plyr]] is a set of tools for a common set of problems: you need to *split* up a big data structure into homogeneous pieces, *apply* a function to each piece and then *combine* all the results back together.

[[https://github.com/hadley/dplyr][dplyr]] is the next iteration of plyr, focussed on tools for working with data frames (hence the d in the name). It has three main goals:


  


  -  Identify the most important data manipulation tools needed for data analysis
and make them easy to use from R.

  -  Provide blazing fast performance for in-memory data by writing key pieces in
C++.

  -  Use the same interface to work with data no matter where it's stored, whether
in a data frame, a data table or database.

These two are a couple of the other mainstream manipulation tools outside of
base R.
