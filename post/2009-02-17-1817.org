Two R6RS versions are mentioned [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.scheme/browse_thread/thread/5b97a1b6f194a270/ed11a2cd9d9dd979][here]], as is one for PLT, and additionally I am pretty sure that one of the posters here has an implementation that he uses only for his code. 

It doesn't make sense for people to waste time reimplementing the wheel. It would be great if everyone could converge on a single, portable, performant implementation.
