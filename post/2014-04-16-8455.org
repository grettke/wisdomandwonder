#+TITLE: Indenting new curly bracket blocks with smartparens for R

Emacs speaks statistics handle indentation for curly bracket blocks quite well. My preference was to have, after inserting matching opening and closing curly brackets, a newline with the cursor indented one block in. [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/issues/80][This post]] in particular describes the solution; it worked fine as of today.

*Addendum: 2014-04-17*

Here is the code snippet from the above link:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
(sp-local-pair 'c++-mode "{" nil :post-handlers '((my-create-newline-and-enter-sexp "RET")))

(defun my-create-newline-and-enter-sexp (&rest _ignored)
  "Open a new brace or bracket expression, with relevant newlines and indent. "
  (newline)
  (indent-according-to-mode)
  (forward-line -1)
  (indent-according-to-mode))

#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/wiki/Permissions#pre-and-post-action-hooks][Here]] is a link to the documentation on using pre and post pair handlers.
