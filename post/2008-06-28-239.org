  [[http://www.colorforth.com/][colorForth]] is a redesign of [Forth] for the 21st century. It also draws upon a 20-year evolution of minimal instruction-set microprocessors. Now implemented on modern PCs, it runs stand-alone without an operating system. Applications are recompiled from source with a simple optimizing compiler.

It is the child of Chuck Moore, the creator of Forth.
