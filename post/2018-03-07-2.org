#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) How To Detect Duplicate Hydra Heads: I've Got Way Too Many And I'm Losing Track

abo-abo's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] functionality makes it easy to build great GUIs. I like the
head feature. The problem I'm running into is that I keep stomping on my head
definitions. For example I define one Hydra as ~_R_esolve~ and then somehow I overlook
the fact and I create another another as ~_R_emember~, forgetting about the
first one.

How do you make sure not to stomp on other Hydra heads when you forget?
