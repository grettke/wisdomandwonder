#+TITLE: A Calendar Framework For Emacs

[[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][emacs-calfw]] is a calendar framework for Emacs. It looks beautiful, thoughtful,
well thought out, and well-developed. That is from reading its landing page,
I never used it. I use Google Calendar, and, this package is still intriguing
because every question I could come up with was well answered on that landing
page.
