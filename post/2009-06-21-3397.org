#+TITLE: One Man's Scheming

[[http://kernelbob.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/scheming-part-7-the-reader/][Here]] is the guide for one man's path of implementing a Scheme interpreter in C. Why did he do it?



#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  
Why?
I don't know Scheme. I took a couple of classes that used Lisp way back when, but don't really know Lisp or Scheme. There's no better way to learn a language than to implement it. (-:
I want to write something in C. My C is very rusty, since I've been using Python exclusively for the last year, and C++ for the last fifteen years.
I want to write a garbage collector. They've always fascinated me, but I've never written one.
I have some research ideas about garbage collection that I want to explore.

That looks like an excellent reason to me!
