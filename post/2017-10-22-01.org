#+TITLE: (Hardware) Best Inexpensive Monitor Ever

Last year I searched for a monitor with these attributes:
- 23-inch
- Great color and bright from all angles easy for all-day viewing
- Cables: HDMI, DVI, and VGA
- Inexpensive because of the obvious and also the possibility of building a
  2x2 monitor grid

The [[http://amzn.to/2h0gXK6][ASUS VS239H-P 23-Inch Full HD 1920x1080 IPS HDMI DVI VGA Back-lit LED Monitor]]
is my winner: it meets all of the criteria.

It is easy to use and looks great. One year old it still is selling well. It
is an easy purchase because 8,299 owners ranked it a 4.5/5 so I'm not alone
here.

Now join the club.
