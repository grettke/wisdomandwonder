#+TITLE: Cost For Building a FORTH Based Personal Computer?

How much would it cost to build a personal computer using a TI [[https://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads.html][Launchpad]] and [[http://www.calcentral.com/~forth/forth/][eForth]]?

It would need to output over HDMI and accept a USB keyboard. FAT32 for storage would make it easier to manage, too. 

It is not this simple.
