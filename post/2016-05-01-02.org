#+TITLE: Chez Scheme Now Open Source

The other night I was daydreaming about buying a [[http://www.scheme.com/][Chez Scheme]] license so I
checked up on their license costs.

[[https://github.com/cisco/chezscheme][They]] are now [[https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/blob/master/LICENSE][Apache Licensed OSS]].

Funny timing as they opened up only days prior.

[[https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/issues][The issue board]] is already active.

=#chez= on Freenode is [[https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/issues/5][blessed]] though the channel doesn't seem to be up yet.

This is all delightful.
