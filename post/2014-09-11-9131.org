  While using `package.el' fulfills a long-awaited dream for easily adding and upgrading Emacs libraries, I now feel upgrading packages is much more complex than what I anticipated.

At least two of the packages I use daily (Org and Helm) require to be installed from inside a fresh Emacs session (emacs -Q), where nothing has been loaded.

I had wondered but never found out why one must follow this approach when installing org from scratch. Good to know!
