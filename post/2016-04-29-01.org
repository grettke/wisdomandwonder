#+TITLE: Bind to Control-Meta-Super-Hyper in Emacs

To sate my curiosity, as you would expect, you *can* bind to
Control-Meta-Super-Hyper in Emacs. Perfect. [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html][Xah explains]] how to maybe get
=Hyper= on your keyboard. Good inspiration for building an Emacs keyboard. Nice
to have another keyspace.
