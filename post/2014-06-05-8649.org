#+TITLE: Never say that you "don't have time"

Never say that you "do not have time for N". Instead say that you "do not value N". 

Every time you utter the former phrase, you teach yourself to ignore what is really going on, and you will eventually believe what you are telling yourself.

That isn't to say that you may, or even should, say this out loud. 

Keep it to yourself, and you will find things becoming easier for you to stomach.
