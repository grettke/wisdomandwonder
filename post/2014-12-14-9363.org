#+TITLE: One Heart Apart

Can we help people out half the world away? If that is too far, then can we help our people on our own continent? If that is too far, then what about our state, our city, or even our next-door neighbors?

Humans are only as far away from us as we are from our own heart. When you gain access to your heart, you are instantly connected with all other human beings. Once connected, your next step is to do something about it.

Every human is only one heart apart from one another.

The space, compassion, love, and the sheer grandeur contained within the human heart make a trillion universes look like a sweet little grain of sand in comparison.
