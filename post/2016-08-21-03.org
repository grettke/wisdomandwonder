#+TITLE: How To Build A USB Puzzle Box?

It would be fun to build a USB puzzle box. Here is how it would work after you
plug it in:

- It would illuminate it's buttons in an entertaining pattern
- If you punch in the secret code it would unlock it's storage drive
- If you punch in the wrong code it would reboot your computer

It is supposed to be fun. I haven't thought too deeply about this, but it is
supposed to be fun no encryption or anything. The security comes from the
device simply *not even showing up* as a storage device until you "unlock" it.

Since I'm on OS X, [[http://www.colinkraft.com/macusbhid/macusbhid.php][this]] seemed like a good place to start.
