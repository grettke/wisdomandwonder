#+TITLE: Guardians of our Society

Last Friday, a friend of mine shared with me his time, thoughts and ideas. We had a great discussion that, among other things, got to the topic of warriors and peacemakers in our society. 

We talked about, generally, how those members of society, the /guardians/ of our values and beliefs, /must/ embody these very standards. 

Today I read [[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-12033002?print=true][this]] article. How inspiring.
