#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It is my pleasure to announce that Xavier Leroy and Didier RÃ©my's course on Unix system programming in Objective Caml is now available in english at this address :

[[http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/]]

If you had a look at the individual publications of the chapters announced on the project feed you may want to have a look again: some parts of the text were improved and a few translation errors were corrected in the final version.

This course looks like a /lot/ of fun!
