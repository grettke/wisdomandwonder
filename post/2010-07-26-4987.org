#+TITLE: My old leather coat

While waiting for the Roadcrafter suit to arrive; I decided to get my old leather coat out of storage. Purchased at the flea market in Orange County, CA sometime in the mid-nineties, I'd somehow managed never to wear it. While some may lament the 90's shoulder-pad styling, it is hard not to like the southwestern influenced design. 

Thus far it has been pretty comfortable, the leather seems sturdy, and you know... I don't mind the smitten looks that I receive while wearing it one bit ;).[[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/OldLeatherCoatFront.jpg][[[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/OldLeatherCoatFront-150x150.jpg]]]][[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/OldLeatherCoatBack.jpg][[[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/OldLeatherCoatBack-150x150.jpg]]]]
