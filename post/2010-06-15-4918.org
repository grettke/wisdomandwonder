#+TITLE: Motorcycling Enterprisesâ€™ Safe Rider Course

Not having ridden for 12 years or so, I thought it would be good to get back in the saddle again with some off-street street-time and re-learning of good safety habits already under my belt. Luckily for me a slot opened up in [[http://www.saferidertraining.com/][Motorcycling Enterprises]]' Safe Rider Course. It was a lot of fun. 

The teachers provided excellent in-classroom and on-the-track training; balancing good exercises with 1-on-1 attention that made a big difference in how quickly you acquired the skill(s).

Unfortunately for others I'm sad to see that they are retiring this year. While there are plenty of MSF certified classes out there, I'm still hoping that their trainers decide to take over their business.
