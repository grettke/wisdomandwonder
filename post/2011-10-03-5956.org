#+TITLE: SchemaSpy: A Graphical Database Schema Metadata Browser

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/][SchemaSpy]] is a Java-based tool that analyzes the metadata of a schema in a database and generates a visual representation of it in a browser-displayable format. It lets you click through the hierarchy of database tables via child and parent table relationships as represented by both HTML links and entity-relationship diagrams. It's also designed to help resolve the obtuse errors that a database sometimes gives related to failures due to constraints.

This is an excellent tool in its own right; and if nothing else for its beautiful use of [[http://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]]. 

See the example(s) [[http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/sample/relationships.html][here]].
