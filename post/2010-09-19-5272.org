#+TITLE: Do you really want to rev it like that?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  FYI, but engine stresses go up as the square of RPM.

IOW, double the revs, and you quadruple the stresses on the engine parts. Triple the revs, and you increase stress by a factor of 9x.

If there's no compelling reason to have the engine spinning at high revs (ie, I want the power), I don't.

Above is theoretical.
