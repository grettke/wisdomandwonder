The last time I spoke to a friend of mine who knows both Scheme and Common Lisp (among /many/ other programming languages), his current language of choice was Python. More or less, he said that it just "feels right" (I need to pick his brain more on this). 

Is Lisp the future of Python? Do Lispers gravitate towards Python? I'm not sure yet, but [[http://www.prescod.net/python/IsPythonLisp.html][this paper]] aims to shed some light on both of those questions.
