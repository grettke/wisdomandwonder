#+TITLE: R7RS Initial Results of Implementor Intentions Poll

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The following all intend to support R7RS small:

 * Per Bothner (Kawa)
 * Will Clinger (Larceny)
 * Shiro Kawai (Gauche)
 * Manuel Serrano (Bigloo) - "not sure about libraries"
 * Alex Shinn (Chibi) - "already fully implemented, but lacking tests"
 * Felix Winkelmann (Chicken)

The following were less committal, but open, and their
implementations are flexible enough to implement R7RS in
third-party code:

 * Kent Dybvig (Chez) - "if it's as simple as you say I don't see why not"
 * Matthew Flatt (Racket) - "if there's sufficient user demand"
 * Andy Wingo (Guile) - "probably"

The following are simply unable to implement R7RS or uninterested
in standards:

 * Taylor Campbell (MIT) - "MIT lacks the infrastructure for modules"
 * Jonathan Shapiro (TinyScheme) - thinks call/cc should be removed
 * Jeffery Mark Siskind (Stalin) - "no longer working on Stalin"
 * Michael Sperber (Scheme48) - "no time even for R6RS"

No one refused to implement based on the content of the standard,
or cited any features as showstoppers.

That last part is important; R6RS didn't have that quality.
