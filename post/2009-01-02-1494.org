#+TITLE: Books on Fractals

I've been investigating books on fractals. [[http://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Book-Fractals-Art-Nature/dp/981021426X/ref=wl_it_dp/184-3022509-2177704?ie=UTF8&coliid=I2U65XXEP5P41L&colid=QDKYO6OQUU4O][The Pattern Book: Fractals, Art, and Nature]] looks pretty good.

I am interested in studying and implementing them. 

Can you recommend any?

[[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/FLAOH/cbnhtml/]["The Fish and Chips Book"]] was recommended.
