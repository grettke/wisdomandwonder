MetS as a result of fructose consumption exacerbates the deleterious effects of
TBI on cognitive function. We propose a framework for a potential model in which
fructose and TBI affect systems related to cell energy metabolism, which
converge on intracellular pathways that regulate brain plasticity and cognitive
function (Figure 7). Our results show the harmful impact of metabolic disease on
the outcome of TBI with regards to mitochondrial biogenesis, synaptic
plasticity, and cognitive function. These data suggest that fructose consumption
reduces neural resilience and may predispose the brain toward cognitive
dysfunction and lifelong susceptibility to neurological disorders.
