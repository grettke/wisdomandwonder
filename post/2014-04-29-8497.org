#+TITLE: Being a doer and not a sayer

People who don't dig their own drinking wells don't mind water pollution.

People who don't farm their own food don't mind ground pollution.

People who don't clean up their own messes don't mind landfills.

What you do entitles what you say.

By that definition, we should't say much, but do more.
