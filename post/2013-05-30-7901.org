#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel]] is about letting many different languages work together. Programming
languages live in blocks inside natural language Org-mode documents. A piece
of data may pass from a table to a Python code block, then maybe move on to an
R code block, and finally end up embedded as a value in the middle of a
paragraph or possibly pass through a gnuplot code block and end up as a plot
embedded in the document.
#+END_QUOTE

My current approach is to use multiple languages, build scripts, intermediate
files to share data, and finally weaving it together inside of LaTeX. The
babel way looks intriguing, with excellent support (via Emacs modes) for
numerous languages. Very exciting.
