#+TITLE: Teaching and Entertainment

Every "modern" teacher knows that teaching requires a non-zero amount of entertainment in order for attention to be held. Entertainment, on the other hand, requires no teaching for the viewer's attention to be held, although it often results in a more moving experience for the consumer. 

For the consumer, it is definitely worth their time to determine whether that thing which they are consuming is teaching, or entertainment, because today's producers are really, really great at convincing you that you are being taught when you are really just being entertained.
