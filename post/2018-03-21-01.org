#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) If You Enjoy Writing Even A Little Bit With Emacs Then Add This Em-Dash Code Now

The EM-DASH provokes mixed feelings mostly in writers, and maybe readers if
they notice it (probably the writers are the ones noticing it while reading).
But the EM-DASH is a really nice way to break up a sentence when a COMMA or a
SEMI-COLON or a COLON just won't do it.

The usage advice out there keeps it really simple—when you use the EM-DASH don't put
any spaces between in and the text it is separating.

Here is the code—it deserves such a prime-placement as using CONTROL and your
number row!
