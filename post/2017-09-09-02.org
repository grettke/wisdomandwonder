#+TITLE: Anybody Miss The Kill-Ring When They Use Their Host OS

Here "Host OS" means the operating system on which you run Emacs.

When I use my host OS by muscle memory I try to use the Kill Ring just like I
do in Emacs and then I get a painful surprise: I have to copy everything that
I need somewhere else and then copy it back. Yuck. Can you recommend a
solution for this on macOS?

[[https://github.com/browse-kill-ring/browse-kill-ring][browse-kill-ring]] makes the kill ring really easy to use.
