#+TITLE: Alive and Healthy: Feeding Your Brain For Fun Or Focus (Podcast 26)

[[http://aliveandhealthy.com/audio-podcasts/feeding-your-brain-for-fun-or-focus/][Podcast]]:

Your happiness is easily in your control by making your mind your best friend.

Create an environment where your mind can thrive instead of making it your
worst enemy who knows every trick to get you caught up with its junk.

What you eat creates the environment for your own freedom or slavery; you are
your own creator of your joy and your misery.

Happy brain; happy owner.
