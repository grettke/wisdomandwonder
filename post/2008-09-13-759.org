In DrScheme you can comment out code either using semicolons or by using a "box".

The way that it works is that you:
1. Select the code you want to put in a comment box.
2. Go to the Scheme menu and select Comment Out With a Box.

You may find this particularly useful when you get to the structure template definitions in chapter 6. It makes them much nicer to write, read, and maintain.
