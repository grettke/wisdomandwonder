#+TITLE: SCIgen - An Automatic CS Paper Generator

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [[http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/][SCIgen]] is a program that generates random Computer Science research papers, including graphs, figures, and citations. It uses a hand-written context-free grammar to form all elements of the papers. Our aim here is to maximize amusement, rather than coherence. 

One useful purpose for such a program is to auto-generate submissions to conferences that you suspect might have very low submission standards.

There are seemingly a number fun things that you could do with this!
