  The Fortress programming language is a general-purpose, statically typed, component-based programming language designed for producing robust high-performance software with high programmability.

In many ways, Fortress is intended to be a “growable language”, i.e., a language that can be gracefully extended and applied in new and unanticipated contexts.
