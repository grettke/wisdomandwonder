Last year some of my [[http://www.geekbookclub.org/web/guest/home][friends]] and I both attended and presented at [[http://barcampmilwaukee.com/][Barcamp Milwaukee]]. When you have a bunch of people coming together to discuss things about which they are really passionate, well, you can't beat it. It was a lot of fun, I met a lot of wonderful people, and even made some new friends. You can watch a video about that event [[http://ourmedia.org/node/380137?format=flv][here]].

I just heard the news that BarCamp Madison #2 is getting lined up. Here are the details:
