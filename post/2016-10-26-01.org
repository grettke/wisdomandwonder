#+TITLE: Techne (Emacs Friendly Keyboard): Operations Keys

The most important keys on any keyboard for an Emacs user are the /Operation
Keys/ (I made up that term). Without them Emacs would be useless. For Techne
(the new name for my Emacs keyboard project) I decided to use symbols instead
of letters for them.

The operations cluster is on both the left and right side of the keyboard.
Yes, that is a full twenty keys just to make life happier in Emacs! I love
keyboards so dedicating twenty keys to a critical task is perfect for me. These
sections live on a eight row by sixteen column layout so there is plenty of
room. It's bottom left corner is position (1,1) (Row, Column) increasing as
you go up and to the right (ala Cartesian coordinates). In the table I wrote
the key name and then the symbol. The picture only includes the symbol.

Legend: C# (column number)

| Row | Four  | Five  | Six   | Seven   | Eight |
|-----+-------+-------+-------+---------+-------|
| Two | Hyper | Super | Meta  | Control | Space |
| One | Alt   | GUI   | Ultra | Shift   | Enter |

Ultra is: =C-m-S-H=. Emacs can [[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10197/bind-to-control-meta-super-hyper-in-emacs][handle that]] including the =Shift= modifier along
with it. In case you haven't encountered it yet, [[https://www.wisdomandwonder.com/article/10146/every-emacser-can-use-hyper-on-every-usb-hid-keyboard][here]] is how to get all of the
Emacs modifiers on a /modern/ USB keyboard.
