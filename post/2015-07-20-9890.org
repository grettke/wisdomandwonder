#+TITLE: Should I Do The Two-Speed Conversion

My single-speed is great. Won't be out-riding this bicycle any time soon. Still, everything needs tweaks. A video about the [[http://www.rekluse.com/][Rekluse Clutch]] got me thinking about my bicycle. It wouldn't hurt to have a two-speed without having any additional gear (weight isn't gear). This [[http://mccraw.co.uk/sram-automatix-review/][SRAM Automatix hub]] seems like a great way to do it because it is totally adjustable to your preference.
