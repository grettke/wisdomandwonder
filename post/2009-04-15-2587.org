#+TITLE: People in Pain

Most would agree that it is probably impossible to "reason with" people who are in pain since they don't often act in a manner that you would expect (read "normal"). The trouble, though, is that often times you can't see their pain, and that a lot of people today seem to be in it. It is no wonder why you might have noticed that so many people seem to "act strangely" these days.
