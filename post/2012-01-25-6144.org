#+TITLE: ENTERPRISE DATA MODELING

Last semester (Fall 2011) I taught "ENTERPRISE DATA MODELING" at [[http://www.carrollu.edu/][Carroll University]]. Carroll is a great school and teaching the class was a lot of fun. 

A mentor of mine shared that "A teacher's job is to create an environment in which learning is likely to occur.". Thank you for sharing that.
