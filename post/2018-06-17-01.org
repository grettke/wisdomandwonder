#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) Personal Grammar Reminder Affect vs Effect

I always forget a few grammar rules and can't seem to get them remembered so I
wrote an Elisp snippet to help me remember. Langtool catches this but it isn't
worth waiting. It seems silly to me to write a reminder, but, I bet hundreds of
us Emacs users face this. The definition is my own, and includes my opinion
about how /not/ to use both words!

affect is followed by a noun in the form of \"X affects Y\". For example
\"Choosing between tabs or spaces for indentation affects our happiness.\"
In the past tense it is followed by a preposition before the noun.
For example \"Most people are deeply affected by the their choice between
using tabs or spaces for indentation.\"

Effect is a noun. It is an outcome or result of a verb. For example
\"Choosing spaces for indentation had a positive effect on her happiness.\"

There are other definitions for affect and effect and you probably
shouldn't use them.")
