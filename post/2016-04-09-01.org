#+TITLE: Ortho-Linear Emacs and VI Keyboard Design 8

For creating key-binding name-spaces (key-spaces), modifier keys, key-chords (single and
dual key) and Hydras each have unique strengths. For my use case, I wanted a
bigger modifier key-space so I started there with Super.

Although Super is supposed to be reserved non-native packages, it is already
getting scarfed up because the native key-spaces are painfully overcrowded. To
top it off, when you run Emacs on Windows, Windows intercepts a bunch of
key-presses for itself and never sends them to Emacs. Yea you can disable
some, but not all and it is irritating. For my configuration, this is a
showstopper issue and all of workaround are too painful. I enjoy using
modifier keys, so I turned to Hyper.

#+HTML: <!--more-->

Initially I thought it would be simple as buying a keyboard with ~Hyper~ on it.
*Wrong*. *Wrong*. Compared to the painful workarounds out there to reproduce Hyper
on a keyboard without it, building a keyboard with Hyper on it seemed like
walk in the park in comparison. Although I've battled the urge to design and
assemble a keyboard for years because I know that someone else has done it
better, this weekend I finally broke-down and indulged myself with some mock-ups.

They key top legend is busy if not simple and its laid out like this

- Left Side
  - Top: Press the key with =Shift=
  - Bottom: Press the key without any modifier
- Right Size
  - Top: Press the key with =Fn= and =Shift=
  - Bottom: Press the key with =Fn=

This 8th mock-up feels perfectly suited /for me/.

The thing that I like about is that:
- It has a familiar QWERTY layout
- No typewriter slowdown junk
- Power keys are all operated with the power fingers
- Mostly symmetrical
- Shift and Function handle everything that I want
- Greek alphabet in order, so simple
- No need to program and reprogram, super simple
- Key-chord has taught me the power of the power-finger two-button press, so
  Function and Option do fine as single keys, combining with nearby keys for
  common actions
- No finger-killing put every modifier key in one row
- It is an ANSI 104 without: ScrollLock, BreakPause and duplicate keys
- For my VI friends, Escape is an easy-to-reach two-finger press using Fn
- Someone has surely laid it out this way already, so I can buy it from them

This didn't take too much time, but I probably spent a little too long on it :).

Re-published because I broke my RSS feed syndicated for Planet Emacsen and
@hober fixed it. Thank you @hober.
