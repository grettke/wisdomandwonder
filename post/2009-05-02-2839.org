#+TITLE: Emulating the CRT for Video Games That Need It

[[http://www.bogost.com/games/a_television_simulator.shtml][Here]] is a good article about an effort that was made to make Stella, an Atari 2600 emulator, render the screen according the behavior of a CRT rather than an LCD. The differences are clear, and perhaps more interesting to folks who grew up playing games on such consoles :).

Whatever this case, this must have been an interesting programming problem.
