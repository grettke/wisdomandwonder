#+TITLE: Org-Mode's Two Most Useful Data Table Functions That You Probably Never Used

It might be hard to admit it for us Emacsers but most of us are pretty
comfortable using Excel (or its clones) for data management. Maybe the fun
stops there but it doesn't have to.

Here are the two most important functions for getting the most out of working
together with Org-Mode data tables and Excel (without having to use literate
programming):

- Do your work in Excel
- Export it to a tab separated (TSV) file
- Import that into Org with ~org-table-import~
- Do you work
  - Work with it manually
  - Do simple sorting with ~org-table-sort-lines~
  - Handle copy pasted tabular data from wherever with ~org-table-convert-region~
- Export that back to a Excel TSV with ~org-table-export~

It might seem pretty simple but this is a great foot in the door to start
integrating Org-Mode into your data workflow.
