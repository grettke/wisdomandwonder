#+TITLE: Bought a helmet

After a good bit of research I decided to go with a Shoei RF1100. After a few hundred miles I've found it to be really nice; comfortable, a lot of air goes through it, and it doesn't squeal when you are sitting behind a windshield like a couple of reviews that I had read suggested.

Perhaps the most bothersome discovery is the ridge on the top of my head that is going to force me to purchase some extra padding or something to level out the top of the helmet so it quits giving me a headache!

One "funny" thing I found in the owner's manual was a warning that if you purchase the Matte Black helmet then you need to be extra, extra-careful about protecting its finish. Great!
