=data.table= is a nice option for retaining the familiarity of a dataframe while
opening the door for pass-by-reference semantics and a more SQL-like query
language. The literature is really wonderful too providing all levels of detail
ranging from the 10-minute introduction to the entirety of the API itself.







The 10-minute introduction is really revealing of things that you would probably
enjoy in your personal analytical workflow whether you obtain them with
=data.table= or elsewhere. The short introduction is also revealing that whatever
solution you choose requires sincere and focused mastery in order to truly
utilize its power without making major, major mistakes.
