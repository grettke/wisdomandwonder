#+TITLE: Edit a source block with its name shown in org


My preference is to rely upon heading property inheritance to define source block
names. That way, you can just do your work knowing "where" you are working and
keep it simple by not having to name everything. That was just fine until I
wrote a document where I /needed/ to name each source block. 

It gets easy to forget the source block's name. Not the end of the world, but very nice to know.






#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
(defun gcr/org-edit-src-code-plus-name ()
  "Edit the well-described source code block.

Attribution: URL `https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-09/msg00778.html'"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((eop  (org-element-at-point))
         (name (or (org-element-property :name (org-element-context eop))
                  "‡•ê"))
         (lang (org-element-property :language eop))
         (buff-name (concat "*Org Src " name "[" lang "]*")))
    (org-edit-src-code nil nil buff-name)))
