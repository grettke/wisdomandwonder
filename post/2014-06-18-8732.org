#+TITLE: Drop of water

A drop of water struggles so hard to return to the ocean. The ocean welcomes it
back with open arms. That is not the time for the ocean, with all of its magnitude
and unlimited beauty and kindness, to remind the drop that it came from the ocean,
left up into the atmosphere, and to came the Earth to serve it, and it is natural for it to
eventually come home, and that the ocean was waiting the whole time.
