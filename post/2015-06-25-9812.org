#+TITLE: What to do when great ideas appear during meditation?

Meditation brings silence. Silence provides space for new ideas to appear. It makes sense to record them. Keep a voice recorder near by and capture them and get back to your practice.

It is at your discretion as to whether or not it is your mind providing that great idea or not!
