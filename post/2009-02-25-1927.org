#+TITLE: A Scheme Timeline

Sometimes understanding the history behind a technology and a community can make it easier to understand. A few months ago I wanted to better understand the history of the various reports on Scheme so I made some notes in the form of a timeline.

It includes everything up to R6RS along with the IEEE standard, and publishing of [[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][SICP]] and [[http://www.htdp.org/][HtDP]]. Obviously a lot more things could be added here but I wasn't trying to take notes for an exhaustive history. All of the sources for the notes can be found in the dot-file below.

The timeline is [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/a-scheme-timeline.png][here]]; and source file is [[http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/schemetimeline.dot%20][here]].
