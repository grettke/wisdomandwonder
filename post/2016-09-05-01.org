* Result

[[https://youtu.be/c0z7dh1JAZM][The Story Of blackboard-bold-mode]]

* Plan

- Evaluate sound-dampening foam
- Record the audio and video simultaneously in a conversational style and edit
  the video to fit the time-line
  - Love conversational style; curious about how to reduce it to the core
    content

* Execution

** Preparation

- Minimal

** Execution

- Spoke more loudly

** Post Production

- Minimal
  - Added logo
  - Sped up video content to make it fit the time-line or removed some

* Outcome & Feedback

- Spent only 2 hours and I'm happy with the result
- Conversation (audio and video) were recorded separately from the content. It
  is difficult *not* to synchronize them /but rather/ to make them work well
  together. In this screencast, the content more or less makes sense. I think
  that I could do it better.
- Weighing the balance between getting the content out there in an imperfect
  form versus planning forever and rarely publishing anything.
- Missed light misplacement hilariously causing humongous eyebrows
