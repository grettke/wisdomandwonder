#+TITLE: Seal your boots *before* the snow falls this year!

[[http://amzn.to/2bEEuMv][Seal]] your boots *before* the snow falls this year!

I went the Beeswax route. It worked great. Take your time to seal it up nice.
Cut your chamois strips first; a few 2"x2" pieces are fine. Set up your waxing
station with your Atsko beeswax, strips, boots, and heat source. I used a hair
dryer. Wish that I had done this with every pair of boots that I'd ever owned!

Reminds me, ought to do this for my sandals, too.
