#+TITLE: Glass Drinking Glasses

Was it a happy-accident that glass drinking glasses have been in use for hundreds of years and they don't leach any dangerous chemicals into their contents and thus into our bodies?

Did that lull us into false sense of security where we assume that drinking container vendors would only provide us with things that would not poison us?
