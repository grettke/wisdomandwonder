#+TITLE: Computing History at Bell Labs

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In 1997, on his retirement from Bell Labs, Doug McIlroy gave a fascinating talk about the “History of Computing at Bell Labs.”

[[http://research.swtch.com/2008/04/computing-history-at-bell-labs.html][Here]] is one man's transcription of that talk.

I only skimmed over it (at the moment I'm not interested in what /was/); but nonetheless it /does/ look like a great talk with a lot of fun and interesting bits in there.
