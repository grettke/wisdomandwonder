#+TITLE: Bren√© Brown: The price of invulnerability

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UoMXF73j0c][YouTube]]
- "equally fatalistic answers yet more creative"
- "on the verge of bliss and picturing something horrible happening"
- The fatalistic response if not universal
  - Is a symptom of the universal
  - We are losing our tolerance for vulnerability
- "Vulnerability is absolutely at the core of fear and anxiety and shame and
  very difficult emotions that we also experience"
- "Vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, of love, of belonging, of
  creativity, of faith"
- "Perfection is a tool to protect ourselves"
- "Faith - vulnerability = extremism"
- "Spirituality is inherently vulnerable"
- "We live in a culture that tells us at there is never enough (goodness)"
- "We are not extraordinary enough"
- "Somehow an ordinary life has become synonymous with a meaningless life"
- "In our ordinary life in ordinary moments is where we can find the most joy"
- Numbing society
  - Most addicted, medicated, obese, in-debt, adult cohort, busy society
- "We stay so busy that the truth of our lives can't catch up"
- "You cannot selective numb emotion"
  - Numb pain, numb joy
- How to recover
  - Practice gratitude
  - Stop and be thankful for what we have
  - Honor what is ordinary about our lives
  - The people we love
  - Play, community, nature (honor what is ordinary)
- If don't experience those good things, our reservoirs will be empty when the
  bad things happen
