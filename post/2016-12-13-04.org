#+TITLE: On Writing Well

William Zinsser's [[http://amzn.to/2gJcTxY][On Writing Well]].

On story telling well? He does it.

On training well? He does it.

Do yourself a favor and buy a new copy because it is maddening to see
foreign notes scribbled fervently throughout its pages. How are these people
tarnishing this sacred soil of your and Zinsser's intersection? Horribly is
how.

Your first read through will leave you /dying/ for the second time that you read
it.

Surprisingly the book is appropriate for computers programmer of any flavor.
