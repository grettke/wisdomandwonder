Every design and walkthrough teaches something new.

The following are some of them that were the most helpful to me.

* Whole Build

** Planck

*** 3D Printed

**** Plastic

- Metal top plate, 3d printed plastic body ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/34riqo/planck_pcb_3d_printed_milled_case/][Reddit]], [[https://imgur.com/a/nwrZV][Imgur]])
- Via discussion
  - PCB make it easier to do reducing build time
  - OLKB provides the [[http://olkb.com/reference/design][design specs for their keyboards]]
  - Standard pinout makes using other firmware easy
  - [[https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-build-your-very-own-keyboard-firmware-t7177.html][Firmare configuration]] is determine by your whole-case design
    - Teensy++ mentioned
- Via build
  - etch/prime, and paint the top plate matte black
    - Had [[http://m.homedepot.com/p/Rust-Oleum-Automotive-12-oz-Self-Etching-Primer-Spray-Paint-249322/202097278][used]]
    - Next time would powder coat it
  - print the milled bottom case
    - might have to break it up into pieces small enough for the printer to
      print
    - acetone "welds" the separate pieces together
  - visible/mentioned tools: needle-nose pliers, pliers, x-acto, solder
    wick, solder sucker, [[https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51792.0][SIP sockets]] so don't have to solder LEDs

**** Carbon Fiber
