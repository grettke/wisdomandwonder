#+TITLE: (Emacs+Org-Mode) Warn About Unexpanded Macros On Export

[[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-09/msg00873.html][This]] post discussed the issues with failing to report macro expansion issues
during export of an =org= document. Most would want publishing to fail if a
macro is not defined. Soon, it will.

It is now addressed, as confirmed in that same thread.
