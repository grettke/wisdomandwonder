#+TITLE: Warn about unexpanded macros on export in org-mode


[[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-09/msg00873.html][This]] post discussed the issues with failing to report macro expansion
issues during export of an =org= document. Most would want publishing to
fail if a macro is not defined. Soon, it will.







It is now addressed, as confirmed in that same thread.
