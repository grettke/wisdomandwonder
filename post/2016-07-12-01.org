#+TITLE: About Your Friend...The One Who Is Angry All The Time

You got a friend who is angry all time?

You ever ask them why and they never have an answer or if they do it makes no sense?

I've got an answer for you on their behalf:

- It is the *only* option they've got
- They *can't* see what it is
- If they could, they would tell you that they don't like it, either
