#+TITLE: Simplest Document Setup for a Logo

My goal is to create a logo. It doesn't have to be a [[http://www.logodesignlove.com/next-logo-paul-rand][Paul Rand]] quality logo.
Instead, /I just gotta like it/. Adobe Illustrator (AI) is a fine tool for the
job.

AI is flexible. Working in it feels more to me like programming than
illustration. Don't get me wrong though, it is a tool for designers, and, I
am not. Although *every* Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) application includes at least
one built in JavaScript interpreter, I am not talking about programming here.
Instead the similarities between programming and illustrating are that

- You are working in your cognitive space with the computer as the meta-medium
- Creativity ebbs and flows, it is critical
- So too having a plan is critical

My plan follows.

#+HTML: <!--more-->

This is my first attempt. It will be wrong in most ways and right in some.

As I learn more I will revise this document.

* Desire

- The /destination/ (artifacts)
  - Create a logo
  - Use it for
    - Website favicon
    - Wordpress
    - Social sites
    - Letterhead
    - Business cards
    - Signs
    - Posters
    - Smartphones (Android and iOS)

- The means (attributes of the process of reaching the destination)
  - Version control: branching and tagging
  - Keeping AI quick: font manager?
  - Training: more required?
  - Re-use: utilize dynamic symbols to use logo across destinations
    - Artboards too
  - Leverage all of AI's placement tools

Where do I begin?

* Training

[[https://www.udemy.com/adobe-illustrator-cc-tutorial/learn/v4/overview][Adobe Illustrator CC Tutorial - Training Taught By Experts]] rocks. It
demonstrates how to do tons of stuff. Although zero coding is involved,
programmers will find the cognitive and technical flow familiar and fun. This
was enough to get producing /something/ versus /nothing/. More though it prepared
me for taking advantage of the great AI resources on the AI website. That
website also rocks. The rest of the blogosphere also became my trawling site

What do I plan to do with this desire and training?

* Decisions

- RGB va CMYK
  - Destinations are both screen and print
  - \rarr CMYK
- PPI
  - AI complains if it is too low for PDF export
  - Vendors require high resolution
  - We need high resolution to support any destination
  - 1 dot = 1 pixel
  - \rarr 300
- Align New Objects to Pixel Grid
  - Destinations are both screen and print
  - \rarr Yes

* Implementation

** File

- Start AI
- File \rarr New
- Name: =TBD=
- Profile: Print
- Number of Artboards: 4
  - Because
    - Logo
    - Banner
    - Banner with Slogan
    - Business Card
    - Do I need a 16x16 Artboard for the Favicon or do I just create it on
      export?
  - Arranged by: Column
- Units: Pixels
- Width and Height: full numbers, pixels cannot be fractional
- Color Mode: CMYK
- Raster Effects: High (300ppi)
  - "printers need at least 300 pixels for each inch"
  - "Note: you don’t have to worry about DPI for vector objects created in
    Illustrator or CorelDRAW — they print well at any size. The DPI relates
    only to bitmap images traditionally handled by Photoshop."
    - So why are we worrying about this?
    - We aren't worrying. We are just planning on making the document "Pixel
      Perfect" so that when it is send to "Web" media it will minimize
      anti-aliasing. That is why we're using Pixels everywhere.
- Preview Mode: Pixel
- Align New Objects to Pixel Grid: TRUE
- OK
- Verify the Artboards are positioned correctly
  - Go into Pixel Preview mode
  - Verify the Artboard is aligned
  - If not, align it with the Artboard Tool
    - It should snap into place

*** Effects

- Document Raster Effects Settings \rarr High (300 ppi)
  - *Should already be set*

*** Preferences

- General
  - Keyboard Increment \rarr 1px
- Selection & Anchor Display
  - Snap to Point: 8px
- Units
  - General: Pixels
    - *Should already be set*
  - Stroke: Pixels
    - *Should already be set*
  - Type: Pixels
    - *Should already be set*
- Guides and Grid
  - Gridline every: 64px
  - Subdivisions: 8px
  - Note: Try 1 and 1 for ultimate control

*** Transformation (Scaling)

- Check "Align to Pixel Grid" if it is not already checked

*** View (Moving)

- Snap to Pixel \rarr True
- Snap to Point \rarr True

** Logo

*** Artboard

- Open Logo
- 5"x5"
- Width: 2400px
- Height: 2400px
- Unsure what the last two do because the Artboard is *not* configured with those
  dimensions
- Constrain proportions: true
- To set the Artboard dimensions correctly
  - File \rarr Document Setup \rarr Edit Artboards
- Panel Menu \rarr Rearrange Artboards

*** Dynamic Symbol

- Draw the parts
- Select all of them
- Symbol Panel Menu \rarr New Symbol
  - Name: =TBD=
  - Export Type: Graphic
  - Symbol Type: Dynamic
  - Enable guide for 9-Slice Scaling: No
  - Align to Pixel Grid: YES
- Delete it and place it again

*** Logo

- Begin implementation

* Saving

- Accept the defaults
  - No personal experience with deviating
- Verify warnings are acceptable
