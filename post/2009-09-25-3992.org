#+TITLE: Looking at Generic Functions in Scheme

A common criticism of Scheme is that it does not have generic methods; resulting in the tedium of having to call variations of the same function but for different types. Wanting to learn more about this, within Scheme, I was pointed at TinyCLOS [[http://community.schemewiki.org/?Tiny-CLOS][here]] and [[http://chicken.wiki.br/tinyclos][here]], for reference.
