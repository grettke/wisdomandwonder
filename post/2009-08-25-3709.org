  Part of our development environment is a visual programming language similar to [[http://scratch.mit.edu/][Scratch]]. The visual language provides a drag-and-drop interface for assembling procedures and event handlers that manipulate high-level components of Android-based phones.

  We parse the visual programming language into an S-expression intermediate language, which is a domain-specific language expressed as a set of Scheme macros, along with a Scheme runtime library.
