Having avoided setting up a nice LaTeX/BiBTeX build chain in org-mode, and instead leaving it all to the latter, it was wonderful to watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyvpSVl4_dg][this]] overview of org-ref. There is a lot of discussion on the org list about different folks workflows. This looks like a really, really nice one with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/org-ref.org][org-ref]].
