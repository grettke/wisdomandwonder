#+TITLE: Getting Healthy And Happy Is Not Difficult It Is Just Different

It is OK to be different and it is OK to be happy. The surprise is that when
you are happy you no longer feel different or disconnected from anybody.

A twenty-eight day investment at least buys you twenty-eight happy days and
maybe even more.
