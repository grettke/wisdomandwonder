Ran out of time last week so here is a picture of the reassembled rack of carburetors. For the heck of it, re-checked the previously 1-finger-tightened float bowl screws, and they were not as tight as I had left them. Re-tightened them. Decided that I had better replace the air filter so as not to gross-up these immaculate carbs. Found out that it is reusable, great. Why are there insect remains in the air cleaner box? They and the grime and crap need to be removed, so out came the brake cleaner, even cleaned up the shifter lever. Decided to re-check the carb holder (shrouds that hold the carbs on the engine manifold) and they were somehow even harder than last year. They are rock hard and must be replaced.
