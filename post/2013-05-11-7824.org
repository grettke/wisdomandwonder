#+TITLE: The Conc Returns

Last Sunday I got the '05 ZG1000 Conc out. Checked the tire pressure, oil, turn signals, and made sure no rodents had taken up residence. Started right up. Somehow she rides even better than last year, the GL footpeg lowering kit and rised handlebars make it feel like a totally different bike. Mileage: 11,992. If I hit 18k this summer that would be fun, but either way I won't need another oil change until end of the season :).
