[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-view.html][org-indent-mode]] immediately struck me as perfect, but my personal preference
is to limit text width something around 80 columns. Making
=org-hide-leading-stars= true is the perfect balance.







[[https://github.com/fniessen/orgmk][orgmk]] seems to simplify org-mode exporting.







[[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog/wp]] looks very interesting, but manually posting is easy enough for now.







Some users visualize source block delimeters differently. Those visualizations
might be nice to add to [[https://github.com/akatov/pretty-mode][pretty-mode]].







Andreas [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-03/msg00325.html][posted]] two ways in babel to store a variable. The example is just nice
to have when you are getting into babel.







There are a few ways to continue code listings in beamer, but [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-03/msg00331.html][this]] one seems
most simple.







May as well enable [[http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/ox-overview.html][markdown export]] in addition to beamer.







[[http://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-dependencies.html][org-enforce-todo-dependencies]] disallows tree completion flags when incomplete
children exist.







[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html][org-plot]] supports plotting.







The current Clojure namespace is maintained between source blocks now in babel.







[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/CDLaTeX-mode.html][CDLaTeX]] seems like a nice idea to use in org-mode.







[[https://github.com/titaniumbones/org-writers-room][org-writers-room]] looks like a great idea; asked author to post a screenshot.







[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][org-export-exclude-tags]] allows you to block export of specified sub-trees.







Rainer submitted a patch to prevent R from stomping on session variables.
