#+TITLE: An example cause of burnout

There are many recipes for burnout.

One of them by analogy is to operate a 28 ton earth moving machine powered by a 2 horsepower (hp) engine attached to an unlimited fuel supply (use your imagination). 

It doesn't matter how capable the machine is or the value of the fuel you are using, the engine is insufficient, but will run for a while, before it "burns out".
