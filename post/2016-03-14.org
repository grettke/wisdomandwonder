#+TITLE: Interruptions During Meditation Practice Are Gifts

When you /get serious/ about your meditation practice you will surely encounter
external interruptions you had never before imagined. Your first reaction will
be frustration and anger at them. That is fine and it is normal. The fun comes
when you take these interruptions as an opportunity for expansion.

Turn them into your practice. Take the critical phone call about the issue that
everyone will forget tomorrow. Tell the kids playing in the hallway to have fun
and to be careful not to trip. Come to think of it, those interruptions seem
pretty typical. It is your reaction to it that is atypical; that is what
contains the magic.
