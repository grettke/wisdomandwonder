#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Joel Bartlett's original Scheme->C system has been in stealth mode for some years now, but with a recent re-license under F/OSS terms by HP, the allocation of a web site [[http://scheme2c.alioth.debian.org/]], the integration of all known useful patches including LINUX/i386 and LINUX/amd64 ports, and uploading into the Debian incoming queue, this zippy R4RS Scheme is on the move again!
