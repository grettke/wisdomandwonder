#+TITLE: Flow Control in Selenium IDE Scripting

Adding to the Selenium IDE's already awesome "save your behind in every kind of situation possible" behavior, [[https://github.com/davehunt/selenium-ide-flowcontrol][here]] is a plugin that adds the flow control constructs that are so sorely missed from the base language. This is a powerful, powerful addition that makes some horrible tasks... bearable.
