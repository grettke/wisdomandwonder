  Oddly, graphics processing is very functional, yet procedural languages are used to teach it. In a nutshell, matrices operate on matrices operate ... . In between some of the stages, drawing takes place; the rightmost argument is the beginning of the scene. Years ago, I gave up learning OpenGL because it was so tedious.
