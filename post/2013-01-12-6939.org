#+TITLE: Calling functions with optional arguments from the mini-buffer

Surely one of the first things VIers want to know as do the rest of us is how to move forward N characters (or backward or whatever) from the mini-buffer in EMACS. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Arguments.html][Here]] is how it is done, using the universal argument. So to move forward 100 chars:



#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    
C:u 100, C:f

#+END_EXAMPLE

Thanks [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][FUCO]] for providing a better solution:

  There's also a faster way. Just hold down control key (or meta key, by default the binding is on both) and type the number, then execute the command or invoke minibuffer with M-x

So, C-2 C-0 C-f will move you 20 characters. It's neat because you don't have to release control, you just hit the rest of the keys in sequence.
