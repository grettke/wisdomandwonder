#+TITLE: De-invent don't re-invent!

The common goal humans undertake is to reinvent themselves.

Don't!

You were sent to this Earth perfect.

Abandon all the limiting ideas about yourself that you invented during your time
here so that you may return to the perfect human being that you truly are.

De-invent don't re-invent!
