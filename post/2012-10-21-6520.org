#+TITLE: BackOFF Brake Light Signal Modulator

Last year I had a Signal Dynamics BackOFF Brake Light Signal Module installed.

Not much more to say than "it just works" and more importantly it has never let me down.

My riding is more around cars and highway traffic than other motorcycles, so it is more than worth its price.
