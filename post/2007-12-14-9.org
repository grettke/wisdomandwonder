#+TITLE: How do you practice?

Someone noticed that I've learned how to practice guitar. I asked what they meant by that, and they said that I “start slow, memorize the piece, and keep practicing, a little faster each time”. That is what works for me. When it comes to learning how to become a better programmer, I'm not sure that it is so simple (not to say guitar is simple of course!).

How do you practice programming?

I've got some ideas on how I do it, but it I'm going to take some time to think about it. 

That post is over the hills and far away!
