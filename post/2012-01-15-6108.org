#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Folks, 

As promised I have put up a blog post on how to get Dolphin running native under Wine (in this particular case on Mac OSX using a free product called WineSkin). You can find the blog at: 

[[http://object-arts.com/blog/blog.html]] 

There are a few videos to go along with the blog and these can be found in the OA video library at:

Best regards
