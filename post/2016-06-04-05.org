- "Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change"
- "You gotta dance with the one who brung ya"
- "TED is the failure conference; very few people here are afraid to fail and
  have failed miserably many times"
- "The credit goes to the man in the arena"
- "Shames drives "Never good enough" and "Who do you think you are?""
- Regarding men and shame, a male attendee shared that "You say to reach out,
  tell our story, be vulnerable... but [the most important women in my life]
  would rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When
  [men] reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us and don't
  tell me it is [from other guys] it is the women in my life who are harder on
  me than anyone else".
- "Shame is an epidemic in our culture"
- "Empathy is the antidote to shame"
- "Me too; the two most powerful words when we are in struggle"
- "Vulnerability is the path back to finding each other"
