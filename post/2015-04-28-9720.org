#+TITLE: How to Do Yoga Backwards

There are amazing athletes in yoga class. They do perfect poses. My mind wonders "must one be a perfect athlete to get the best out of our asanas?". My heart knows the truth: all are welcome and the journey is the teacher, not the destination (in this case, the pose). In [[https://yogainternational.com//article/view/i-dont-overcome-my-body-i-adapt-yoga-to-my-body?utm_source=Yoga+International&utm_campaign=1f613690e6-RSS_WEEKLY_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_943c6d823b-1f613690e6-88553361][this article]], a yogi delightfully answers the questions that may only be answered with truth.
