Ï• From Death To Birth

Two easy questions:

* Why do we live?

* What happens when we die?

This is one of these books that only make sense when read at the right time. 

When is the right time? That is unique to the reader. Though when it is, the wisdom shared within cannot be traded for anything in this mortal realm.
