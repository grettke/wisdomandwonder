#+TITLE: (Happiness) Old Fashioned Himalayan Style Chai Recipe

* Chaiâ€”One Pot Method (makes two cups)

This recipe (modified by me) comes right out of [[https://www.freebook.aliveandhealthy.com/order-13048606][The Happiness Revolution]] which
is available [[https://www.freebook.aliveandhealthy.com/order-13048606][free here]]. Totally worth reading now.

- Ingredients
  - 1 cup of cow milk
  - 1 cup of water
  - \frac12{} inch fresh ginger root
    - More or less to taste
    - More concerned with juice then mass, that is where the flavor is)
  - 1 pinch powdered saffron
    - More or less to taste
  - 6 whole pods of cardamom
    - Green
    - More or less to taste
  - 2 tablespoons sugar
    - More or less to taste
  - 1 tablespoon black tea
    - Black tea as the benefit of caffeine to which you don't develop a
      tolerance. It works the same every time.
    - I like [[http://amzn.to/2H0sAvK][Wagh Bakri]]
  - 3 grinder turns of black pepper
    - Usually only during winter
    - More or less to taste
- Tools
  - Pot big enough to hold the ingredients
  - Vessel big enough to hold the the number of cups of water and milk that
    you are using

    of juice
  - [[http://amzn.to/2EbVpna][Coffee Grinder]]: for the cardamom
    - only hold the cup over the pot instead of the grinder when you dump in
      the seeds otherwise the steam will get inside the grinder and make it
      unhappy
  - Tea Spoon: to peel the ginger
    - Or paring knife if you are a ninja
- Steps
  - Place pot on counter-top. Add pepper, black tea, saffron, and
    cardamom.
  - Add water to vessel. Peel and grate ginger. Grab ginger fiber
    and place in pot. Use water to rinse grater into pot. Add
    all of remaining water to pot.
  - Bring pot to a boil. Fill vessel with milk.
  - When water reaches a boil, pour in milk.
  - Allow chai to come to a boil, then quickly remove from the heat. Stare at
    pot the entire time otherwise it will boil over. Maitain focus without
    distraction here. Do this two more times.
  - Strain through a fine strainer so as to filter out
    tea and herbs.
  - Either add sugar to individual servings so everyone can sweeten to their
    taste or add it to pot.
  - Serve. The chai party begins.
